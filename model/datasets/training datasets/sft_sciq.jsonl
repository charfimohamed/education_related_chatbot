{"prompt":"Question: What kind of reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data?\nOptions:\n A. reflexive\nB. inductive\nC. skepticism\nD. deductive","completion":"deductive\nExplanation: These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are observed while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated to be the part controlling the response to that task. Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and animals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the many changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is evidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one. Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesisbased science. Descriptive (or discovery) science aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible answer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue."}

Trans fat is rare in nature but is manufactured and added to foods to preserve freshness. Eating foods that contain trans fat increases the risk of heart disease. Trans fat may be found in such foods as cookies, doughnuts, crackers, fried foods, ground beef, and margarine."}
{"prompt":"Question: All living organisms must have what ability, in order to make more organisms like themselves?\nOptions:\n A. absorption\nB. cloning\nC. reproduction\nD. variation","completion":"reproduction\nExplanation: All living organisms must have the ability to reproduce. Living things make more organisms like themselves. Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will create more life. If a species cannot create the next generation, the species will go extinct. Reproduction is the process of making the next generation and may be a sexual or an asexual process. Sexual reproduction involves two parents and the fusion of gametes , haploid sex cells from each parent. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically unique and increases genetic variation within a species. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent. It occurs without a fusion of gametes and produces offspring that are all genetically identical to the parent."}
{"prompt":"Question: In the cardiovascular system, net filtration pressure represents the interaction of osmotic pressures and what other pressures?\nOptions:\n A. uptake\nB. hydrostatic\nC. homeostatic\nD. hydrophilic","completion":"hydrostatic\nExplanation: Interaction of Hydrostatic and Osmotic Pressures The normal unit used to express pressures within the cardiovascular system is millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). When blood leaving an arteriole first enters a capillary bed, the CHP is quite high\u2014about 35 mm Hg. Gradually, this initial CHP declines as the blood moves through the capillary so that by the time the blood has reached the venous end, the CHP has dropped to approximately 18 mm Hg. In comparison, the plasma proteins remain suspended in the blood, so the BCOP remains fairly constant at about 25 mm Hg throughout the length of the capillary and considerably below the osmotic pressure in the interstitial fluid. The net filtration pressure (NFP) represents the interaction of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures, driving fluid out of the capillary. It is equal to the difference between the CHP and the BCOP. Since filtration is, by definition, the movement of fluid out of the capillary, when reabsorption is occurring, the NFP is a negative number. NFP changes at different points in a capillary bed (Figure 20.16). Close to the arterial end of the capillary, it is approximately 10 mm Hg, because the CHP of 35 mm Hg minus the BCOP of 25 mm Hg equals 10 mm Hg. Recall that the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of the interstitial fluid are essentially negligible. Thus, the NFP of 10 mm Hg drives a net movement of fluid out of the capillary at the arterial end. At approximately the middle of the capillary, the CHP is about the same as the BCOP of 25 mm Hg, so the NFP drops to zero. At this point, there is no net change of volume: Fluid moves out of the capillary at the same rate as it moves into the capillary. Near the venous end of the capillary, the CHP has dwindled to about 18 mm Hg due to loss of fluid. Because the BCOP remains steady at 25 mm Hg, water is drawn into the capillary, that is, reabsorption occurs. Another way of expressing this is to say that at the venous end of the capillary, there is an NFP of \u22127 mm Hg."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is lowered when salts go into ion form?\nOptions:\n A. charge\nB. voltage\nC. resistance\nD. power","completion":"resistance\nExplanation: Most of the body\u2019s resistance is in its dry skin. When wet, salts go into ion form, lowering the resistance significantly. The interior of the body has a much lower resistance than dry skin because of all the ionic solutions and fluids it contains. If skin resistance is bypassed, such as by an intravenous infusion, a catheter, or exposed pacemaker leads, a person is rendered microshock sensitive. In this condition, currents about 1\/1000 those listed in Table 20.3 produce similar effects. During open-heart surgery, currents as small as 20 \u03bcA can be used to still the heart. Stringent electrical safety requirements in hospitals, particularly in surgery and intensive care, are related to the doubly disadvantaged microshock-sensitive patient. The break in the skin has reduced his resistance, and so the same voltage causes a greater current, and a much smaller current has a greater effect."}

{"prompt":"Question: The spinal cord develops, cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into what?\nOptions:\n A. membrane and glia\nB. muscles and glia\nC. neurons and glia\nD. jelly and glia","completion":"neurons and glia\nExplanation: Spinal Cord Development While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural tube. However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It is a long, straight cord with a small, hollow space down the center. The neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior portions, but it also has a dorsal\u2013ventral dimension. As the neural tube separates from the rest of the ectoderm, the side closest to the surface is dorsal, and the deeper side is ventral. As the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into the neurons and glia of the spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral tissues will be associated with motor functions."}

Excess chemicals can be picked up by rainwater. The chemicals can end up in streams, ponds, lakes, or the ocean. Dissolved fertilizer causes tremendous numbers of water plants and algae to grow. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes or the coastal oceans."}
{"prompt":"Question: There are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes. the three shared characteristics among these types\u2014what makes them wetlands\u2014are their hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and this?\nOptions:\n A. stibnite soils\nB. hydric soils\nC. sandy soils\nD. niya soils","completion":"hydric soils\nExplanation: may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey. Wetlands Wetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water. Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth. Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the water\u2019s surface. There are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes (Figure 44.25). The three shared characteristics among these types\u2014what makes them wetlands\u2014are their hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils."}
{"prompt":"Question: Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection; this is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. diversifying selection\nB. extra selection\nC. multiplying selection\nD. shedding selection","completion":"diversifying selection\nExplanation: Diversifying Selection Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while the intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit. Known as diversifying selection (Figure 19.8), this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male\u2019s territory. In this case, both the alpha males and the \u201csneaking\u201d males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which can\u2019t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak copulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would not blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators. The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is it called when two waves in the same medium pass one another?\nOptions:\n A. accumulation\nB. interference\nC. frequency\nD. synchrony","completion":"interference\nExplanation: Any two waves in the same medium undergo wave interference as they pass each other. At the location where the two waves collide, the result is essentially a summation of the two waves. In some places, a wave crest from one source will overlap a wave crest from the other source. Since both waves are lifting the medium, the combined wave crest will be twice as high as the original crests. Nearby, a wave trough will overlap another wave trough and the new trough will be twice as deep as the original. This is called constructive interference because the resultant wave is larger than the original waves. Within the interference pattern, the amplitude will be twice the original amplitude. Once the waves pass through each other and are alone again, their amplitudes return to their original values."}
{"prompt":"Question: Noble gases are monatomic because they only contain one of what?\nOptions:\n A. atoms\nB. ions\nC. molecules\nD. charges","completion":"atoms\nExplanation: The Noble Gases The noble gases are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. Because the noble gases are composed of only single atoms, they are monatomic. At room temperature and pressure, they are unreactive gases. Because of their lack of reactivity, for many years they were called inert gases or rare gases. However, the first chemical compounds containing the noble gases were prepared in 1962. Although the noble gases are relatively minor constituents of the atmosphere, natural gas contains substantial amounts of helium. Because of its low reactivity, argon is often used as an unreactive (inert) atmosphere for welding and in light bulbs. The red light emitted by neon in a gas discharge tube is used in neon lights."}
{"prompt":"Question: What fills the epidermal cells that make up fingernails and toenails?\nOptions:\n A. cellulose\nB. chromatin\nC. amino acids\nD. keratin","completion":"keratin\nExplanation: Fingernails and toenails consist of specialized epidermal cells that are filled with keratin . The keratin makes them tough and hard, which is important for the functions they serve. Fingernails prevent injury by forming protective plates over the ends of the fingers. They also enhance sensation by acting as a counterforce to the sensitive fingertips when objects are handled. Nails are similar to claws in other animals. They cover the tips of fingers and toes. Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds. As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed. Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer. There are no nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt a lot!."}

Ebola outbreaks have been limited mainly to remote areas of the world. However, they have gained extensive media attention because of the high mortality rate\u201423 percent to 90 percent\u2014depending on the strain. The primary hosts of the viruses are thought to be apes in west central Africa, but the virus has also been isolated from bats in the same region."}
{"prompt":"Question: Most reptiles lay what kind of eggs?\nOptions:\n A. hard-shelled\nB. amniotic\nC. umbilical\nD. roe","completion":"amniotic\nExplanation: All reptiles have a cloaca , a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail. Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell. These eggs can be placed anywhere as they don't have to be in a moist environment, like the eggs of amphibians. However, not all species lay eggs, as certain species of squamates can give birth to live young."}
{"prompt":"Question: About how full is the outer energy level in metalloids?\nOptions:\n A. nearly empty\nB. half full\nC. three-fourth full\nD. a quarter full","completion":"half full\nExplanation: Metalloids such as boron have an outer energy level that is about half full. These elements need to gain or lose too many electrons for a full outer energy level to come about easily. As a result, these elements are not very reactive. They may be able to conduct electricity but not very well."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which bone is derived from the fusion of four very small coccygeal vertebrae?\nOptions:\n A. coccyx\nB. cranium\nC. clavicle\nD. femur","completion":"coccyx\nExplanation: The body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body\u2019s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene, requiring amputation of the affected region."}

{"prompt":"Question: Different interatomic distances produce different lattice what?\nOptions:\n A. qualities\nB. surfaces\nC. energies\nD. weights","completion":"energies\nExplanation: in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal structure; Z+ and Z\u2013 are the charges on the ions; and Ro is the interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions). Thus, the lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other parameters are kept constant, doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For example, the lattice energy of LiF (Z+ and Z\u2013 = 1) is 1023 kJ\/mol, whereas that of MgO (Z+ and Z\u2013 = 2) is 3900 kJ\/ mol (Ro is nearly the same\u2014about 200 pm for both compounds). Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can compare the lattice energy of MgF2 (2957 kJ\/mol) to that of MgI2 (2327 kJ\/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of F\u2013 as compared to I\u2013."}

{"prompt":"Question: Kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, measured by their temperatures are known as:\nOptions:\n A. visible energy\nB. thermal energy\nC. atmospheric energy\nD. solar energy","completion":"thermal energy\nExplanation: Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, measured by their temperature. Thermal energy always moves from matter with greater thermal energy to matter with less thermal energy, so it moves from warmer to cooler substances. You can see this in the Figure below . Faster-moving particles of the warmer substance bump into and transfer some of their energy to slower-moving particles of the cooler substance. Thermal energy is transferred in this way until both substances have the same thermal energy and temperature. For a visual introduction to these concepts, watch the animation \u201cTemperature vs. Heat\u201d at this URL:."}
{"prompt":"Question: Metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat, which helps what type of animal conserve and maintain heat at a relatively constant body temperature?\nOptions:\n A. lizard\nB. warm-blooded (endotherm)\nC. cold-blooded (ectotherm)\nD. amphibian","completion":"warm-blooded (endotherm)\nExplanation: Animal Bioenergetics All animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb. These nutrients are converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells. Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as glycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues. No energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animal\u2019s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat. If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded animal and called an endotherm. The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers. The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat. The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate. The rate is measured variously in joules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories). Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal\/g, and fat contains about 9 kcal\/g. Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms. Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal\/day, and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal\/day. Even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant body temperature. An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcal\/day. Energy Requirements Related to Body Size Smaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones (Figure 33.4). Therefore, smaller animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature. This results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal."}
{"prompt":"Question: Natural selection cannot create new variations in organisms - these new variations must be created by what, which are usually associated with some sort of abnormality?\nOptions:\n A. radiation\nB. mutation\nC. infection\nD. pollution","completion":"mutation\nExplanation: Introduction All life on Earth is related. Evolutionary theory states that humans, beetles, plants, and bacteria all share a common ancestor, but that millions of years of evolution have shaped each of these organisms into the forms seen today. Scientists consider evolution a key concept to understanding life. Natural selection is one of the most dominant evolutionary forces. Natural selection acts to promote traits and behaviors that increase an organism\u2019s chances of survival and reproduction, while eliminating those traits and behaviors that are to the organism\u2019s detriment. But natural selection can only, as its name implies, select\u2014it cannot create. The introduction of novel traits and behaviors falls on the shoulders of another evolutionary force\u2014mutation. Mutation and other sources of variation among individuals, as well as the evolutionary forces that act upon them, alter populations and species. This combination of processes has led to the world of life we see today."}

In the bloodstream, iron picks up oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues; the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Erythrocytes live only 120 days on average, and thus must be continually replaced. Worn-out erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophages and their hemoglobin is broken down. The breakdown products are recycled or removed as wastes: Globin is broken down into amino acids for synthesis of new proteins; iron is stored in the liver or spleen or used by the bone marrow for production of new erythrocytes; and the remnants of heme are converted into bilirubin, or other waste products that are taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile or removed by the kidneys. Anemia is a deficiency of RBCs or hemoglobin, whereas polycythemia is an excess of RBCs."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of radio waves exist in the 540 to 1600 khz frequency range?\nOptions:\n A. am radio waves\nB. microwaves\nC. sound waves\nD. fm radio waves","completion":"am radio waves\nExplanation: AM radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range from 540 to 1600 kHz. The abbreviation AM stands for amplitude modulation, which is the method for placing information on these waves. (See Figure 24.12. ) A carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station, say 1530 kHz, is varied or modulated in amplitude by an audio signal. The resulting wave has a constant frequency, but a varying amplitude. A radio receiver tuned to have the same resonant frequency as the carrier wave can pick up the signal, while rejecting the many other frequencies impinging on its antenna. The receiver\u2019s circuitry is designed to respond to variations in amplitude of the carrier wave to replicate the original audio signal. That audio signal is amplified to drive a speaker or perhaps to be recorded."}

{"prompt":"Question: The thalamus acts as a gateway to and from what?\nOptions:\n A. cortex\nB. pons\nC. medulla oblongata\nD. spine","completion":"cortex\nExplanation: The thalamus acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is the body\u2019s thermostat\u2014it makes sure the body temperature is kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles. The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala. The two amygdala (one on each side) are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces. The cerebellum (cerebellum = \u201clittle brain\u201d) sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks. The cerebellum of birds is large compared to other vertebrates because of the coordination required by flight. The brainstem connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and regulates some of the most important and basic functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing, digestion, sleeping, walking, and sensory and motor information integration."}

{"prompt":"Question: The most important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin used for this?\nOptions:\n A. benign respiration\nB. simple respiration\nC. avian respiration\nD. cutaneous respiration","completion":"cutaneous respiration\nExplanation: 29.3 Amphibians As tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs, although some species of salamanders and all caecilians are limbless. The most important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin used for cutaneous respiration. The fossil record provides evidence of amphibian species, now extinct, that arose over 400 million years ago as the first tetrapods. Amphibia can be divided into three clades: salamanders (Urodela), frogs (Anura), and caecilians (Apoda). The life cycle of frogs, like the majority of amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage and metamorphosis to an adult stage. Some species in all orders bypass a free-living larval stage."}
{"prompt":"Question: What  occur when elements switch places in compounds?\nOptions:\n A. chemical interaction\nB. replacement reactions\nC. chain reaction\nD. chemical reaction","completion":"replacement reactions\nExplanation: Replacement reactions occur when elements switch places in compounds.

Viruses are not cells at all, so they are neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes."}
{"prompt":"Question: Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called what?\nOptions:\n A. chloroplasts\nB. phragmoplasts\nC. cellulose\nD. xanthophylls","completion":"phragmoplasts\nExplanation: Streptophytes Until recently, all photosynthetic eukaryotes were considered members of the kingdom Plantae. The brown, red, and gold algae, however, have been reassigned to the Protista kingdom. This is because apart from their ability to capture light energy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that distinguish plants from protists. The position of green algae is more ambiguous. Green algae contain the same carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of chlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes. Consequently, land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta. The remaining green algae, which belong to a group called Chlorophyta, include more than 7000 different species that live in fresh or brackish water, in seawater, or in snow patches. A few green algae even survive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture in which they can live. Periodic dry spells provide a selective advantage to algae that can survive water stress. Some green algae may already be familiar, in particular Spirogyra and desmids. Their cells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. Some green algae are single cells, such as Chlorella and Chlamydomonas, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. Other algae, like Ulva (commonly called sea lettuce), form colonies (Figure 25.7)."}

{"prompt":"Question: The electrolysis of what substance produces hydrogen and oxygen gases\nOptions:\n A. cholesterol\nB. water\nC. carbon dioxide\nD. hydrocarbon","completion":"water\nExplanation: The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen gases. The electrolytic cell consists of a pair of platinum electrodes immersed in water containing a small amount of an electrolyte, such as H 2 SO 4 . The electrolyte is necessary because pure water does not contain enough ions to effectively conduct a current. At the anode, water is oxidized to oxygen gas and hydrogen ions. At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the function of chloroplasts that are found in plant and algal cells?\nOptions:\n A. mitosis\nB. photosynthesis\nC. spermatogenesis\nD. glycolysis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms. For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts . Only cells with chloroplasts\u2014plant cells and algal (protist) cells\u2014can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize. That is why these organisms, as well as the non-photosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are heterotrophs."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are plants that grow where people don't want them to and can take up space and use resources which hinders growth of more desirable plants?\nOptions:\n A. native plants\nB. shrubs\nC. grasses\nD. weeds","completion":"weeds\nExplanation: We obviously can\u2019t live without plants, but sometimes they cause us problems. Many plants are weeds. Weeds are plants that grow where people don\u2019t want them, such as gardens and lawns. They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants. People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants. Many plants produce pollen, which can cause allergies. Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which disease causes cells to divide out of control\nOptions:\n A. autoimmune diseases\nB. cancer\nC. mutation\nD. arthritis","completion":"cancer\nExplanation: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation."}
{"prompt":"Question: Autocrine signaling takes place within the same what?\nOptions:\n A. tissue type\nB. proteins\nC. organ\nD. cell","completion":"cell\nExplanation: Other Types of Chemical Signaling In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel great distances throughout the body. In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An autocrine (auto= \u201cself\u201d) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling. Local intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the synaptic cleft."}

{"prompt":"Question: What results when gas particles rebound off the walls of their container?\nOptions:\n A. pressure\nB. light\nC. pull\nD. weight","completion":"pressure\nExplanation: Pressure is what results when gas particles rebound off the walls of their container. The basic unit of pressure is the newton per square meter (N\/m2). This combined unit is redefined as a pascal (Pa). One pascal is not a very large amount of pressure. A more useful unit of pressure is the bar, which is 100,000 Pa (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). Other common units of pressure are the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average pressure of Earth\u2019s atmosphere at sea level; and mmHg (millimeters of mercury), which is the pressure generated by a column of mercury 1 mm high. The unit millimeters of mercury is also called a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the mid1600s. A more precise definition of atmosphere, in terms of torr, is that there are exactly 760 torr in 1 atm. A bar equals 1.01325 atm. Given all the relationships between these pressure units, the ability to convert from one pressure unit to another is a useful skill."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term is used for the difference in the placement of an object from one time to another?\nOptions:\n A. displacement\nB. variation\nC. replacement\nD. diffusion","completion":"displacement\nExplanation: Position is the location of the object (whether it's a person, a ball or a particle) at a given moment in time. Displacement is the difference in the object's position from one time to another. Distance is the total amount the object has traveled in a certain period of time. Displacement is a vector quantity (direction matters), where as distance is a scalor (only the amount matters). Distance and displacement are the same in the case where the object travels in a straight line and always moving in the same direction."}

{"prompt":"Question: What umbrella term describes small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions?\nOptions:\n A. macromolecules\nB. atoms\nC. organelles\nD. organisms","completion":"organelles\nExplanation: To see an animation of this DNA molecule, click here (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/rotating_DNA2) . Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions. All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce. ) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack organelles surrounded by a membrane and do not have nuclei surrounded by nuclear membranes; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei. In most multicellular organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the same function. Organs are collections of tissues grouped together based on a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. For example vertebrate animals have many organ systems, such as the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms."}

{"prompt":"Question: What were the first particles with mass to be directly confirmed to have the wavelength proposed by de broglie?\nOptions:\n A. negatrons\nB. protons\nC. ions\nD. electrons","completion":"electrons\nExplanation: Electrons were the first particles with mass to be directly confirmed to have the wavelength proposed by de Broglie. Subsequently, protons, helium nuclei, neutrons, and many others have been observed to exhibit interference when they interact with objects having sizes similar to their de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength for massless particles was well established in the 1920s for photons, and it has since been observed that all massless particles have a de Broglie wavelength \u03bb = h \/ p. The wave nature of all particles is a universal characteristic of nature. We shall see in following sections that implications of the de Broglie wavelength include the quantization of energy in atoms and molecules, and an alteration of our basic view of nature on the microscopic scale. The next section, for example, shows that there are limits to the precision with which we may make predictions, regardless of how hard we try. There are even limits to the precision with which we may measure an object\u2019s location or energy. Making Connections: A Submicroscopic Diffraction Grating The wave nature of matter allows it to exhibit all the characteristics of other, more familiar, waves. Diffraction gratings, for example, produce diffraction patterns for light that depend on grating spacing and the wavelength of the light. This effect, as with most wave phenomena, is most pronounced when the wave interacts with objects having a size similar to its wavelength. For gratings, this is the spacing between multiple slits. ) When electrons interact with a system having a spacing similar to the electron wavelength, they show the same types of interference patterns as light does for diffraction gratings, as shown at top left in Figure 29.24. Atoms are spaced at regular intervals in a crystal as parallel planes, as shown in the bottom part of Figure 29.24. The spacings between these planes act like the openings in a diffraction grating. At certain incident angles, the paths of electrons scattering from successive planes differ by one wavelength and, thus, interfere constructively. At other angles, the path length differences are not an integral wavelength, and there is partial to total destructive interference. This type of scattering from a large crystal with well-defined lattice planes can produce dramatic interference patterns. It is called Bragg reflection, for the father-and-son team who first explored and analyzed it in some detail. The expanded view also shows the pathlength differences and indicates how these depend on incident angle \u03b8 in a manner similar to the diffraction patterns for x rays reflecting from a crystal."}

{"prompt":"Question: The important equation pv = nrt holds true for substances in what state of matter?\nOptions:\n A. solids\nB. liquids\nC. gas\nD. products","completion":"gas\nExplanation: PV = nRT This equation is known as the ideal gas law. An ideal gas is defined as a hypothetical gaseous substance whose behavior is independent of attractive and repulsive forces and can be completely described by the ideal gas law. In reality, there is no such thing as an ideal gas, but an ideal gas is a useful conceptual model that allows us to understand how gases respond to changing conditions. As we shall see, under many conditions, most real gases exhibit behavior that closely approximates that of an ideal gas. The ideal gas law can therefore be used to predict the behavior of real gases under most conditions. As you will learn in Section 10.8 \"The Behavior of Real Gases\", the ideal gas law does not work well at very low temperatures or very high pressures, where deviations from ideal behavior are most commonly observed."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is used to convert concentrations to collisions per second?\nOptions:\n A. speeds factor\nB. frequency factor\nC. collision meter\nD. particles factor","completion":"frequency factor\nExplanation: The frequency factor is used to convert concentrations to collisions per second. Equation 14.39 is known as the Arrhenius equation and summarizes the collision model of chemical kinetics, where T is the absolute temperature (in K) and R is the ideal gas constant [8.314 J\/(K\u00b7mol)]. Ea indicates the sensitivity of the reaction to changes in temperature. The reaction rate with a large Ea increases rapidly with increasing temperature, whereas the reaction rate with a smaller Ea increases much more slowly with increasing temperature. If we know the reaction rate at various temperatures, we can use the Arrhenius equation to calculate the activation energy.

{"prompt":"Question: Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down what?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. carbohydrates\nC. lipids\nD. impurities","completion":"carbohydrates\nExplanation: 24.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down carbohydrates contained in food. The energy released is used to power the cells and systems that make up your body. Excess or unutilized energy is stored as fat or glycogen for later use. Carbohydrate metabolism begins in the mouth, where the enzyme salivary amylase begins to break down complex sugars into monosaccharides. These can then be transported across the intestinal membrane into the bloodstream and then to body tissues. In the cells, glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is processed through a sequence of reactions into smaller sugars, and the energy stored inside the molecule is released. The first step of carbohydrate catabolism is glycolysis, which produces pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, the pyruvate can be converted into lactate to keep glycolysis working. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition to ATP, the Krebs cycle produces high-energy FADH2 and NADH molecules, which provide electrons to the oxidative phosphorylation process that generates more high-energy ATP molecules. For each molecule of glucose that is processed in glycolysis, a net of 36 ATPs can be created by aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited to those generated by glycolysis. While a total of four ATPs are produced by glycolysis, two are needed to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP molecules. In conditions of low glucose, such as fasting, starvation, or low carbohydrate diets, glucose can be synthesized from lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, or glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is almost the reverse of glycolysis and serves to create glucose molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such as the brain, when glucose levels fall below normal."}

{"prompt":"Question: What organ do most fish have that is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water?\nOptions:\n A. nares\nB. lateral line\nC. operculum\nD. eye","completion":"lateral line\nExplanation: Sharks have well-developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey, including a keen sense of smell and electroreception, with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal. Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things, including their prey. Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals. Sharks, together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians, also have a sense organ called the lateral line, which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water, and is often considered homologous to \u201chearing\u201d in terrestrial vertebrates. The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish\u2019s body. Sharks reproduce sexually, and eggs are fertilized internally. Most species are ovoviviparous: The fertilized egg is retained in the oviduct of the mother\u2019s body and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk. The eggs hatch in the uterus, and young are born alive and fully functional. Some species of sharks are oviparous: They lay eggs that hatch outside of the mother\u2019s body. Embryos are protected by a shark egg case or \u201cmermaid\u2019s purse\u201d (Figure 29.12) that has the consistency of leather. The shark egg case has tentacles that snag in seaweed and give the newborn shark cover. A few species of sharks are viviparous: The young develop within the mother\u2019s body and she gives live birth."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg?\nOptions:\n A. spores\nB. gametes\nC. nucleus\nD. parasites","completion":"gametes\nExplanation: Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents. Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg. As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The zygote must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes results. Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis . Meiosis contains two rounds of cell division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is an attitude of doubt about the truthfulness of claims that lack empirical evidence?\nOptions:\n A. conspiracy\nB. speculation\nC. skepticism\nD. independent variable","completion":"skepticism\nExplanation: Skepticism is an attitude of doubt about the truthfulness of claims that lack empirical evidence.

To know whether interference is constructive or destructive, you must also determine if there is a phase change upon reflection. Thin film interference thus depends on film thickness, the wavelength of light, and the refractive indices. For white light incident on a film that varies in thickness, you will observe rainbow colors of constructive interference for various wavelengths as the thickness varies. Example 27.7 Soap Bubbles: More Than One Thickness can be Constructive (a) What are the three smallest thicknesses of a soap bubble that produce constructive interference for red light with a wavelength of 650 nm?

{"prompt":"Question: What class of animals, translated as \u201chead foot\u201d, includes octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus?\nOptions:\n A. mollusks\nB. cephalopods\nC. crustaceans\nD. bivalves","completion":"cephalopods\nExplanation: The visceral mass in the shelled species is characteristically twisted and the foot is modified for crawling. Most gastropods bear a head with tentacles that support eyes. A complex radula is used to scrape food particles from the substrate. The mantle cavity encloses the ctenidia as well as a pair of nephridia. The class Cephalopoda (\u201chead foot\u201d animals) includes octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus. Cephalopods include shelled and reduced-shell groups. They display vivid coloration, typically seen in squids and octopuses, which is used for camouflage. The ability of some octopuses to rapidly adjust their colors to mimic a background pattern or to startle a predator is one of the more awe-inspiring feats of these animals. All animals in this class are predators and have beaklike jaws. All cephalopods have a well-developed nervous system, complex eyes, and a closed circulatory system. The foot is lobed and developed into tentacles and a funnel, which is used for locomotion. Suckers are present on the tentacles in octopuses and squid. Ctenidia are enclosed in a large mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels, each with its own heart. Cephalopods (Figure 15.27) are able to move quickly via jet propulsion by contracting the mantle cavity to forcefully eject a stream of water. Cephalopods have separate sexes, and the females of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time. Although the shell is much reduced and internal in squid and cuttlefish, and absent altogether in octopus, nautilus live inside a spiral, multi-chambered shell that is filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy."}
{"prompt":"Question: Newton\u2019s third law of motion describes what property of forces that means balance?\nOptions:\n A. acceleration\nB. symmetry\nC. magnetism\nD. gravity","completion":"symmetry\nExplanation: 4.4 Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion: Symmetry in Forces There is a passage in the musical Man of la Mancha that relates to Newton\u2019s third law of motion. Sancho, in describing a fight with his wife to Don Quixote, says, \u201cOf course I hit her back, Your Grace, but she\u2019s a lot harder than me and you know what they say, \u2018Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone, it\u2019s going to be bad for the pitcher. \u2019\u201d This is exactly what happens whenever one body exerts a force on another\u2014the first also experiences a force (equal in magnitude and opposite in direction). Numerous common experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, confirm this. It is precisely stated in Newton\u2019s third law of motion. Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. This law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as \u201caction-reaction,\u201d where the force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton\u2019s third law has practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system. We can readily see Newton\u2019s third law at work by taking a look at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in Figure 4.9. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and opposite force back on the swimmer. You might think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems. In this case, there are two systems that we could investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we select the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then F wall on feet is an external force on this system and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of."}

{"prompt":"Question: What nerves attached to the brain are mainly responsible for motor and sensory functions?\nOptions:\n A. stimulation nerves\nB. autonomic nerves\nC. somatic nerves\nD. cranial nerves","completion":"cranial nerves\nExplanation: Cranial Nerves The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions of the head and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic nervous system). There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for \u201cCranial Nerve,\u201d using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves. Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, \u201cOn Old Olympus\u2019 Towering Tops\/A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops,\u201d in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming. An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance. The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or."}

{"prompt":"Question: Stress building up at the same rate over time at a fault causes what phenomenon?\nOptions:\n A. erosion\nB. earthquakes\nC. volcanoes\nD. storms","completion":"earthquakes\nExplanation: When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time. So earthquakes should occur at regular intervals. But, so far, scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years. Around Parkfield, California, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every 22 years. So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993. But that quake came in 2004\u201411 years late ( Figure below )."}

{"prompt":"Question: For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive what?\nOptions:\n A. pulses\nB. proteins\nC. information\nD. signals","completion":"signals\nExplanation: Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or \u2018resting\u2019 membrane charge. Neuronal Charged Membranes The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of plant is the dominant group of land plants?\nOptions:\n A. vascular plants\nB. grass plants\nC. oxygen plants\nD. thermal plants","completion":"vascular plants\nExplanation: Vascular Plants The vascular plants are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants. There are about 275,000 species of vascular plants, which represent more than 90 percent of Earth\u2019s vegetation. Several evolutionary innovations explain their success and their spread to so many habitats. Vascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem The first fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue are dated to the Silurian period, about 430 million years ago. The simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem. Xylem is the tissue responsible for long-distance transport of water and minerals, the transfer of water-soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs, and storage of water and nutrients. A second type of vascular tissue is phloem, which transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes through the plant. Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements, or conducting cells, and supportive tissue. Together, xylem and phloem tissues form the vascular system of plants."}
{"prompt":"Question: The hydroxyl radical is highly reactive because it has what?\nOptions:\n A. unpaired electron\nB. unpaired neutron\nC. paired proton\nD. paired electron","completion":"unpaired electron\nExplanation: Because the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive. (This is true of any substance with unpaired electrons, known as a free radical. ) This hydroxyl radical can react with all kinds of biological molecules (DNA, proteins, enzymes, and so on), causing damage to the molecules and disrupting physiological processes.

{"prompt":"Question: What is a rigid layer that surrounds the plasma membrane of a plant cell?\nOptions:\n A. the nucleic wall\nB. the cell center\nC. the cell wall\nD. mitochondria","completion":"the cell wall\nExplanation: The cell wall is a rigid layer that surrounds the plasma membrane of a plant cell. It supports and protects the cell. Tiny holes, or pores, in the cell wall allow water, nutrients, and other substances to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall is made up mainly of complex carbohydrates, including cellulose."}
{"prompt":"Question: Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form what as readily as second-period elements, and when they do form, they are weaker than those formed by second-period elements?\nOptions:\n A. covalent bonds\nB. magnetic bonds\nC. n bonds\nD. k. bonds","completion":"n bonds\nExplanation: Silicon dioxide, silica, occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms. The usual crystalline form of silicon dioxide is quartz, a hard, brittle, clear, colorless solid. It is useful in many ways\u2014for architectural decorations, semiprecious jewels, and frequency control in radio transmitters. Silica takes many crystalline forms, or polymorphs, in nature. Trace amounts of Fe3+ in quartz give amethyst its characteristic purple color. The term quartz is also used for articles such as tubing and lenses that are manufactured from amorphous silica. Opal is a naturally occurring form of amorphous silica. The contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as illustrated in Figure 18.18. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single CO2 molecules with each of the two oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In contrast, silicon dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen atoms by single bonds directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and SiO4 tetrahedra share oxygen atoms. This arrangement gives a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a macromolecule of silicon dioxide. The difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14 elements to form strong \u03c0 bonds. Secondperiod elements, such as carbon, form very strong \u03c0 bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form \u03c0 bonds as readily as secondperiod elements, and when they do form, the \u03c0 bonds are weaker than those formed by second-period elements. For this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain \u03c0 bonds but only \u03c3 bonds."}

{"prompt":"Question: Some marine algae have evolved special structures capable of what plant process?\nOptions:\n A. pollination\nB. respiration\nC. seed germination\nD. photosynthesis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: in color. Golden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments, where they form a major part of the plankton community. The brown algae are primarily marine, multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds. Giant kelps are a type of brown algae. Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-like stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis. The stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some cases for 60 meters. A variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most complex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages involve multicellularity. Compare this life cycle to that of humans, for instance. Haploid gametes produced by meiosis (sperm and egg) combine in fertilization to generate a diploid zygote that undergoes many rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular embryo and then a fetus. However, the individual sperm and egg themselves never become multicellular beings. Terrestrial plants also have evolved alternation of generations. In the brown algae genus Laminaria, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form (Figure 23.19). Certain other organisms perform alternation of generations in which both the haploid and diploid forms look the same."}

If it does, the potential energy changes back to kinetic energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: Compounds containing an atom of what element, bonded in a hydrocarbon framework, are classified as amines?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. nitrogen\nC. hydrogen\nD. ammonia","completion":"nitrogen\nExplanation: 20.2 Alcohols and Ethers Many organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons can be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon derivative can be formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a functional group, which contains at least one atom of an element other than carbon or hydrogen. The properties of hydrocarbon derivatives are determined largely by the functional group. The \u2013OH group is the functional group of an alcohol. The \u2013R\u2013O\u2013R\u2013 group is the functional group of an ether. 20.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters Functional groups related to the carbonyl group include the \u2013CHO group of an aldehyde, the \u2013CO\u2013 group of a ketone, the \u2013CO2H group of a carboxylic acid, and the \u2013CO2R group of an ester. The carbonyl group, a carbon-oxygen double bond, is the key structure in these classes of organic molecules: Aldehydes contain at least one hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, ketones contain two carbon groups attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, carboxylic acids contain a hydroxyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, and esters contain an oxygen atom attached to another carbon group connected to the carbonyl carbon atom. All of these compounds contain oxidized carbon atoms relative to the carbon atom of an alcohol group. 20.4 Amines and Amides The addition of nitrogen into an organic framework leads to two families of molecules. Compounds containing a nitrogen atom bonded in a hydrocarbon framework are classified as amines. Compounds that have a nitrogen atom bonded to one side of a carbonyl group are classified as amides. Amines are a basic functional group. Amines and carboxylic acids can combine in a condensation reaction to form amides."}

{"prompt":"Question: The group 18 gases that have 8 valence electrons are referred to as what type of gases?\nOptions:\n A. novel\nB. important\nC. metal\nD. noble","completion":"noble\nExplanation: A common way to keep track of valence electrons is with Lewis electron dot structures . In an electron dot structure, each atom is represented by its chemical symbol, and each valence electron is represented by a single dot. Note that only valence electrons are shown explicitly in these diagrams. For the main group elements, the number of valence electrons for a neutral atom can be determined by looking at which group the element belongs to. In the s block, Group 1 elements have one valence electron, while Group 2 elements have two valence electrons. In the p block, the number of valence electrons is equal to the group number minus ten. Group 13 elements have three valence electrons, Group 14 elements have four, and so on.

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of compound, contained in coffee and alcohol, increases urine volume?\nOptions:\n A. anabolic\nB. acid\nC. diuretic\nD. additive","completion":"diuretic\nExplanation: Diuretics and Fluid Volume A diuretic is a compound that increases urine volume. Three familiar drinks contain diuretic compounds: coffee, tea, and alcohol. The caffeine in coffee and tea works by promoting vasodilation in the nephron, which increases GFR. Alcohol increases GFR by inhibiting ADH release from the posterior pituitary, resulting in less water recovery by the collecting duct. In cases of high blood pressure, diuretics may be prescribed to reduce blood volume and, thereby, reduce blood pressure. The most frequently prescribed anti-hypertensive diuretic is hydrochlorothiazide. It inhibits the Na+\/ Cl\u2013 symporter in the DCT and collecting duct. The result is a loss of Na+ with water following passively by osmosis. Osmotic diuretics promote water loss by osmosis. An example is the indigestible sugar mannitol, which is most often administered to reduce brain swelling after head injury. However, it is not the only sugar that can produce a diuretic effect. In cases of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, glucose levels exceed the capacity of the tubular glucose symporters, resulting in glucose in the urine. The unrecovered glucose becomes a powerful osmotic diuretic. Classically, in the days before glucose could be detected in the blood and urine, clinicians identified diabetes mellitus by the three Ps: polyuria (diuresis), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger)."}

They have become habituated to the scarecrow."}
{"prompt":"Question: Earthquakes have both longitudinal and transverse components, and these travel at what?\nOptions:\n A. identical speeds\nB. different speeds\nC. the speed of light\nD. the speed of sound","completion":"different speeds\nExplanation: Earthquakes, essentially sound waves in Earth\u2019s crust, are an interesting example of how the speed of sound depends on the rigidity of the medium. Earthquakes have both longitudinal and transverse components, and these travel at different speeds. The bulk modulus of granite is greater than its shear modulus. For that reason, the speed of longitudinal or pressure waves (Pwaves) in earthquakes in granite is significantly higher than the speed of transverse or shear waves (S-waves). Both components of earthquakes travel slower in less rigid material, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km\/s, and S-waves correspondingly range in speed from 2 to 5 km\/s, both being faster in more rigid material. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through Earth\u2019s crust. The time between the P- and S-waves is routinely used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake. The speed of sound is affected by temperature in a given medium. For air at sea level, the speed of sound is given by."}

{"prompt":"Question: What organism is at the top of the energy pyramid?\nOptions:\n A. primate\nB. carnivore\nC. herbivore\nD. insects","completion":"carnivore\nExplanation: Each step of the food chain in the energy pyramid is called a trophic level . Plants or other photosynthetic organisms ( autotrophs ) are found on the first trophic level, at the bottom of the pyramid. The next level will be the herbivores, and then the carnivores that eat the herbivores. The energy pyramid ( Figure below ) shows four levels of a food chain, from producers to carnivores. Because of the high rate of energy loss in food chains, there are usually only 4 or 5 trophic levels in the food chain or energy pyramid. There just is not enough energy to support any additional trophic levels. Heterotrophs are found in all levels of an energy pyramid other than the first level."}

These molecules come together to form a cell, which is the basis of life. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life. One other molecule, water, is also essential to life, though water is not an organic compound."}
{"prompt":"Question: The barrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of what?\nOptions:\n A. mates\nB. pathogens\nC. nutrients\nD. ecosystems","completion":"pathogens\nExplanation: environment of the body\u2019s soft tissues. Barrier defenses are part of the body\u2019s most basic defense mechanisms. The barrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens. The different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external surfaces of the body, where pathogens may try to enter (Table 21.2). The primary barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin. Not only is the skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as these cells are continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other pathogens with them. Additionally, sweat and other skin secretions may lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away."}

{"prompt":"Question: What causes reduction of elasticity in all organs?\nOptions:\n A. low vitamin D\nB. radiation\nC. age\nD. weight gain","completion":"age\nExplanation: Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic, the arteries and lungs need to be very stretchable. The elastic properties of the arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in the arteries increases and arterial walls stretch when the blood is pumped out of the heart. When the aortic valve shuts, the pressure in the arteries drops and the arterial walls relax to maintain the blood flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling exactly this\u2014the elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through with each pump of the heart. If the arteries were rigid, you would not feel a pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The lungs expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely and elastically when we breathe out. Our skins are particularly elastic, especially for the young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg with no visible sag in their skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces with age. Gradual physiological aging through reduction in elasticity starts in the early 20s."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the outermost layer of the skin?\nOptions:\n A. dermis\nB. nexus\nC. callus\nD. epidermis","completion":"epidermis\nExplanation: The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface. Although the top layer of epidermis is only about as thick as a sheet of paper, it is made up of 25 to 30 layers of cells. The epidermis also contains cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin and hair their color. Melanin-producing cells are found in the bottom layer of the epidermis. The epidermis does not have any blood vessels. The lower part of the epidermis receives blood by diffusion from blood vessels of the dermis."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is chlorine gas produced?\nOptions:\n A. in the nucleus\nB. carbon cycle\nC. epidermis\nD. at the anode","completion":"at the anode\nExplanation: It may be logical to assume that the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, called brine , would yield the same result through the same reactions as the process in molten NaCl. However, the reduction reaction that occurs at the cathode does not produce sodium metal because the water is reduced instead. This is because the reduction potential for water is only -0.83 V compared to -2.71 V for the reduction of sodium ions. This makes the reduction of water preferable because its reduction potential is less negative. Chlorine gas is still produced at the anode, just as in the electrolysis of molten NaCl."}

{"prompt":"Question: The posterior pituitary releases which hormone, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth?\nOptions:\n A. estrogen\nB. insulin\nC. estradiol\nD. oxytocin","completion":"oxytocin\nExplanation: In addition to producing FSH and LH, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (PRL) in females. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is now known to be dopamine. PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it. The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth. The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks. Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth. Contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete. Oxytocin also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. As these cells contract, milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (\u201clet-down\u201d) reflex. Oxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and its release into circulation at the posterior pituitary."}

To achieve a noble gas configuration ( n s 2 n p 6 ), each of these elements needs to gain just one electron, resulting in an anion with a 1\u2212 charge. Similarly, Group 16 elements can obtain an n s 2 n p 6 valence configuration by forming ions with a 2\u2212 charge, and the Group 15 nonmetals will form ions with a 3\u2212 charge. Naming anions is slightly different than naming cations. The end of the element\u2019s name is dropped and replaced with the \u2013 ide suffix. For example, when the chlorine atom (Cl) gains one electron, it becomes the chloride ion (Cl - ). This structure has the same electron configuration as the noble gas argon. Similarly, sulfur can gain two electrons to become the sulfide ion (S 2- ), which also has a noble gas configuration."}

{"prompt":"Question: A, t, g, and c pairs are associated with what substance that is important in genetics?\nOptions:\n A. plasma\nB. bacteria\nC. blood\nD. dna","completion":"dna\nExplanation: Only certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in Figure 3.33. This is known as the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand."}

{"prompt":"Question: Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of what?\nOptions:\n A. folding\nB. translation\nC. transcription\nD. RNA processing","completion":"transcription\nExplanation: Evolution of Gene Regulation Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus. Some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring."}

{"prompt":"Question: Sexually reproducing organisms alternate between which stages?\nOptions:\n A. haploid and diploid\nB. binary and diploid\nC. binary and haploid\nD. diploid and traploid","completion":"haploid and diploid\nExplanation: CHAPTER SUMMARY 7.1 Sexual Reproduction Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The variation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appears to be one of the advantages of sexual reproduction that has made it so successful. Meiosis and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. The process of meiosis produces genetically unique reproductive cells called gametes, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Fertilization, the fusion of haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. Thus, sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid stages. However, the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the timing between meiosis and fertilization vary greatly. There are three main categories of life cycles: diploid-dominant, demonstrated by most animals; haploid-dominant, demonstrated by all fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, demonstrated by plants and some algae."}
{"prompt":"Question: What develops in depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent?\nOptions:\n A. swamps\nB. bogs\nC. ponds\nD. sinkholes","completion":"bogs\nExplanation: Freshwater marshes and swamps are characterized by slow and steady water flow. Bogs develop in depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent. Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation. Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks. The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced. As the oxygen in the water is depleted, decomposition slows. This leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the pH of the water. At a lower pH, nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants. This creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important limiting resource. Some types of bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps) capture insects and extract the nitrogen from their bodies. Bogs have low net primary productivity because the water found in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where does the most important monsoon in the world occur?\nOptions:\n A. southern asia\nB. the atlantic ocean\nC. eastern aisa\nD. northern africa","completion":"southern asia\nExplanation: Monsoons are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water. In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow from water to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land. Monsoons occur in several places around the globe. The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia ( Figure below ). These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there."}

Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it."}
{"prompt":"Question: The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of what?\nOptions:\n A. antennae\nB. cilia\nC. fin\nD. flagella","completion":"flagella\nExplanation: Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges don't have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals."}

{"prompt":"Question: Loss of what eventually threatens other species not impacted directly, because of their interconnectedness; as species disappear from an ecosystem others are threatened by changes in available resources?\nOptions:\n A. technology\nB. oxygen\nC. climate\nD. biodiversity","completion":"biodiversity\nExplanation: Community Dynamics Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time. Sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change. Communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium state. Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time. In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain. Primary Succession and Pioneer Species Primary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes, such as those on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed. On the Big Island, approximately 32 acres of land is added each year. First, weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer species (Figure 45.32). These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. In addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to an ever-growing layer of decomposing organic material and contribute to soil formation. Over time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species."}
{"prompt":"Question: In celsius, what is the boiling point of water?\nOptions:\n A. one hundred degrees\nB. zero degrees\nC. two hundred twelve degrees\nD. ninety eight degrees","completion":"one hundred degrees\nExplanation: The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid. It takes a lot of energy to break all those ionic bonds. As a result, ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. You can see the melting and boiling points of several different ionic compounds in the Table below . To appreciate how high they are, consider that the melting and boiling points of water, which is not an ionic compound, are 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C, respectively."}

You see the child and immediately react. You put on the brakes, steer away from the child, and yell out a warning, all in just a split second. How do you respond so quickly? Such rapid responses are controlled by your nervous system. The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body. It includes the brain and spinal cord, the central nervous system , and nerves that run throughout the body, the peripheral nervous system (see Figure below ). To understand how nervous messages can travel so quickly, you need to know more about nerve cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the outer layer of the adrenal gland called?\nOptions:\n A. adrenal skin\nB. zona reticularis\nC. adrenal cortex\nD. medulla","completion":"adrenal cortex\nExplanation: 17.6 The Adrenal Glands The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex\u2014the outer layer of the gland\u2014produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The adrenal medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine. The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress response and a long-term stress response. A perceived threat results in the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate the fight-or-flight response. The long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex. The mineralocorticoids, chiefly aldosterone, cause sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood pressure."}
{"prompt":"Question: How many digits do primates have on each extremity?\nOptions:\n A. ten\nB. four\nC. five\nD. three","completion":"five\nExplanation: Primates have five digits (fingers or toes) on each extremity.

{"prompt":"Question: Medical problems associated with the body responding poorly to insulin are commonly associated with what disease?\nOptions:\n A. AIDS\nB. pertussis\nC. diabetes\nD. colitis","completion":"diabetes\nExplanation: In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone, but target cells do not respond to the hormone. Often, this is because target cells have become resistant to the hormone. Type 2 diabetes is an example of this type of endocrine disorder. In type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin. As a result, cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood becomes too high. This type of diabetes is usually treated with medication and diet. The addition of extra insulin to the treatment can help some patients."}

They cut away at rock, forming river valleys ( Figure below ). These are destructive forces. The bits and pieces of rock carried by rivers are deposited where rivers meet the oceans. These can form deltas, like the Mississippi River delta. They can also form barrier islands, like Padre Island in Texas. Rivers bring sand to the shore, which forms our beaches. These are constructive forces."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is friction that acts on objects while it is rolling over a surface called?\nOptions:\n A. rolling friction\nB. blowing friction\nC. opposing friction\nD. surface friction","completion":"rolling friction\nExplanation: Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction. You can see what they look like in the Figure below . They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another."}

{"prompt":"Question: The posterior half of the foot is formed by seven tarsal bones. the most superior of these bones is called?\nOptions:\n A. metatarsal\nB. patella\nC. calcareous\nD. talus","completion":"talus\nExplanation: Tarsal Bones The posterior half of the foot is formed by seven tarsal bones (Figure 8.19). The most superior bone is the talus. This has a relatively square-shaped, upper surface that articulates with the tibia and fibula to form the ankle joint. Three areas of articulation form the ankle joint: The superomedial surface of the talus bone articulates with the medial malleolus of the tibia, the top of the talus articulates with the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral side of the talus articulates with the lateral malleolus of the fibula. Inferiorly, the talus articulates with the calcaneus (heel bone), the largest bone of the foot, which forms the heel. Body weight is transferred from the tibia to the talus to the calcaneus, which rests on the ground. The medial calcaneus has a prominent bony extension called the sustentaculum tali (\u201csupport for the talus\u201d) that supports the medial side of the talus bone."}
{"prompt":"Question: If the frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as the natural frequencies of the system, the transfer of what is much more efficient?\nOptions:\n A. heat\nB. sound\nC. energy\nD. light","completion":"energy\nExplanation: 24.4 Energy in Electromagnetic Waves Anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in electromagnetic waves. Sometimes this energy is obvious, such as in the warmth of the summer sun. Other times it is subtle, such as the unfelt energy of gamma rays, which can destroy living cells. Electromagnetic waves can bring energy into a system by virtue of their electric and magnetic fields. These fields can exert forces and move charges in the system and, thus, do work on them. If the frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as the natural frequencies of the system (such as microwaves at the resonant frequency of water molecules), the transfer of energy is much more efficient. Connections: Waves and Particles The behavior of electromagnetic radiation clearly exhibits wave characteristics. But we shall find in later modules that at high frequencies, electromagnetic radiation also exhibits particle characteristics. These particle characteristics will be used to explain more of the properties of the electromagnetic spectrum and to introduce the formal study of modern physics. Another startling discovery of modern physics is that particles, such as electrons and protons, exhibit wave characteristics. This simultaneous sharing of wave and particle properties for all submicroscopic entities is one of the great symmetries in nature."}

{"prompt":"Question: The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from what?\nOptions:\n A. embryonic radicle\nB. sperm radicle\nC. nuclei radicle\nD. organisms radicle","completion":"embryonic radicle\nExplanation: Eudicots Eudicots, or true dicots, are characterized by the presence of two cotyledons. Veins form a network in leaves. Flower parts come in four, five, or many whorls. Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem. (In monocots, vascular tissue is scattered in the stem. ) Eudicots can be herbaceous (like dandelions or violets), or produce woody tissues. Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores. The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the embryonic radicle. Eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants. Many species seem to exhibit characteristics that belong to either group; therefore, the classification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always clearly evident (Table 14.1)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do willow trees produce to kill bacteria?\nOptions:\n A. chlorophyll\nB. salicylic acid\nC. enzymes\nD. cytoplasmic acid","completion":"salicylic acid\nExplanation: Plants don\u2019t have immune systems, but they do respond to disease. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow trees produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products for the same reason. Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other plants of threats to their health, allowing the plants to prepare for their own defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless."}

{"prompt":"Question: What paired organs help regulate blood pressure through sodium ion and water retention and loss?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. kidneys\nC. tissues\nD. lymph nodes","completion":"kidneys\nExplanation: 25.10 The Urinary System and Homeostasis The effects of failure of parts of the urinary system may range from inconvenient (incontinence) to fatal (loss of filtration and many others). The kidneys catalyze the final reaction in the synthesis of active vitamin D that in turn helps regulate Ca++. The kidney hormone EPO stimulates erythrocyte development and promotes adequate O2 transport. The kidneys help regulate blood pressure through Na+ and water retention and loss. The kidneys work with the adrenal cortex, lungs, and liver in the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system to regulate blood pressure. They regulate osmolarity of the blood by regulating both solutes and water. Three electrolytes are more closely regulated than others: Na+, Ca++, and K+. The kidneys share pH regulation with the lungs and plasma buffers, so that proteins can preserve their three-dimensional conformation and thus their function."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the catalysts that occur naturally in living organisms and are primarily protein molecules?\nOptions:\n A. carbohydrates\nB. enzymes\nC. hormones\nD. acids","completion":"enzymes\nExplanation: Enzymes Enzymes, catalysts that occur naturally in living organisms, are almost all protein molecules with typical molecular masses of 20,000\u2013100,000 amu. Some are homogeneous catalysts that react in aqueous solution within a cellular compartment of an organism. Others are heterogeneous catalysts embedded within the membranes that separate cells and cellular compartments from their surroundings. The reactant in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called a substrate. Because enzymes can increase reaction rates by enormous factors (up to 10 17 times the uncatalyzed rate) and tend to be very specific, typically producing only a single product in quantitative yield, they are the focus of active research. At the same time, enzymes are usually expensive to obtain, they often cease functioning at temperatures greater than 37\u00b0C, have limited stability in solution, and have such high specificity that they are confined to turning one particular set of reactants into one particular product. This means that separate processes using different enzymes must be developed for chemically similar reactions, which is time-consuming and expensive. Thus far, enzymes have found only limited industrial applications, although they are used as ingredients in laundry detergents, contact lens cleaners, and meat tenderizers. The enzymes in these applications tend to be proteases, which are able to cleave the amide bonds that hold amino acids together in proteins. Meat tenderizers, for example, contain a protease called papain, which is isolated from papaya juice. It cleaves some of the long, fibrous protein molecules that make inexpensive cuts of beef tough, producing a piece of meat that is more tender. Some insects, like the bombadier beetle, carry an enzyme capable of catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water (Figure 14.28 \"A Catalytic Defense Mechanism\"). Enzyme inhibitors cause a decrease in the reaction rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction by binding to a specific portion of an enzyme and thus slowing or preventing a reaction from occurring. Irreversible inhibitors are therefore the equivalent of poisons in heterogeneous catalysis. One of the oldest and most Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: Spores are generally produced through what type of reproduction?\nOptions:\n A. similar\nB. asexual\nC. sexual\nD. hormone","completion":"sexual\nExplanation: The lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations (Figure 24.16). Spores are generally produced through sexual reproduction, rather than asexual reproduction. The club-shaped basidium carries spores called basidiospores. In the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis. The haploid nuclei migrate into basidiospores, which germinate and generate monokaryotic hyphae. The mycelium that results is called a primary mycelium. Mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that contains haploid nuclei of two different mating strains. This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage. Eventually, the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp, which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground\u2014this is what we think of as a mushroom. The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap."}

{"prompt":"Question: What does an underwater spider use to breathe and keep alive?\nOptions:\n A. forehead air bubble\nB. gills\nC. metallic air bubble\nD. shiny air bubble","completion":"shiny air bubble\nExplanation: 11.8 Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids Children blow soap bubbles and play in the spray of a sprinkler on a hot summer day. (See Figure 11.27. ) An underwater spider keeps his air supply in a shiny bubble he carries wrapped around him. A technician draws blood into a small-diameter tube just by touching it to a drop on a pricked finger. A premature infant struggles to inflate her lungs. What is the common thread? All these activities are dominated by the attractive forces between atoms and molecules in liquids\u2014both within a liquid and between the liquid and its surroundings. Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces. Liquids can, for example, be held in open containers because cohesive forces hold the molecules together. Attractive forces between molecules of different types are called adhesive forces. Such forces cause liquid drops to cling to window panes, for example. In this section we examine effects directly attributable to cohesive and adhesive forces in liquids."}
{"prompt":"Question: While light travels at different speeds in different kinds of matter, the speed of light is constant in what condition?\nOptions:\n A. outer space\nB. vacuum\nC. through glass\nD. under water","completion":"vacuum\nExplanation: Although the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, light travels at different speeds in different kinds of matter. For example, light travels more slowly in glass than in air. Therefore, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down. If light strikes a sheet of glass straight on, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but passes straight through. However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90\u00b0, the wave refracts, or bends. This is illustrated in Figure below . How much light bends when it enters a new medium depends on how much it changes speed. The greater the change in speed, the more light bends."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the \"point\" that refers to the temperature at which water vapor condenses?\nOptions:\n A. melting point\nB. brine point\nC. water point\nD. dew point","completion":"dew point\nExplanation: You\u2019ve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point . If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew ( Figure below ). The dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why?."}
{"prompt":"Question: What organs need constant pressure to filter the blood?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. kidneys\nC. dialysis\nD. arteries","completion":"kidneys\nExplanation: The kidneys also need constant pressure to filter the blood. When the blood pressure drops too low, the kidneys increase the pressure. One way is by producing angiotensin, a blood vessel-constricting protein. This protein also signals the body to retain sodium and water. Together, the constriction of blood vessels and retention of sodium and water help restore normal blood pressure."}

Proof of this is that light retains its original color under water. For example, blue light is still blue under water."}
{"prompt":"Question: Temperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of what?\nOptions:\n A. molecules\nB. particles\nC. nucleus\nD. electrons","completion":"molecules\nExplanation: Water Stabilizes Temperature The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances. Temperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between hydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are formed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called evaporation. Evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of energy and takes heat away from the body. Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e. , ice) (Figure 2.9a). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that ice floats on the surface of a body of water (Figure 2.9b). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of the water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this did not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making life in cold temperatures difficult or impossible."}
{"prompt":"Question: Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the what?\nOptions:\n A. cerebral cortex\nB. nasal septum\nC. cytoplasm\nD. cell wall","completion":"nasal septum\nExplanation: Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the nasal septum. The upper portion of the nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the lower portion is the vomer bone. Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows superiorly. When looking into the nasal cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting from each lateral wall. The larger of these is the inferior nasal concha, an independent bone of the skull. Located just above the inferior concha is the middle nasal concha, which is part of the ethmoid bone. A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is the superior nasal concha. It is much smaller and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is located just lateral to the perpendicular plate, in the upper nasal cavity."}
{"prompt":"Question: What may be lost when waves travel through matter, but not when they travel through space?\nOptions:\n A. matter\nB. energy\nC. frequency\nD. threshold","completion":"energy\nExplanation: As you can see in the Figure above , the electric and magnetic fields that make up an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other. Both fields are also perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels. Therefore, an electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave. However, unlike a mechanical transverse wave, which can only travel through matter, an electromagnetic transverse wave can travel through empty space. When waves travel through matter, they lose some energy to the matter as they pass through it. But when waves travel through space, no energy is lost. Therefore, electromagnetic waves don\u2019t get weaker as they travel. However, the energy is \u201cdiluted\u201d as it travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area."}

{"prompt":"Question: Terrestrial biomes are associated with land, while aquatic ones are associated with what?\nOptions:\n A. plants\nB. water\nC. air\nD. blood","completion":"water\nExplanation: 20.3 Terrestrial Biomes Earth has terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine environments. There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. The same biome can occur in different geographic locations with similar climates. Temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes. Some biomes, such as temperate grasslands and temperate forests, have distinct seasons with cold and hot weather alternating throughout the year. In warm, moist biomes, such as the tropical rainforest, net primary productivity is high as warm temperatures, abundant water, and a year-round growing season fuel plant growth. Other biomes, such as deserts and tundra, have low primary productivity due to extreme temperatures and a shortage of water."}

{"prompt":"Question: The depth of the atmosphere is greatest where?\nOptions:\n A. under water\nB. sea level\nC. the ionosphere\nD. the stratosphere","completion":"sea level\nExplanation: The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level."}
{"prompt":"Question: What small glands are abundant within the mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue?\nOptions:\n A. hypothalamus glands\nB. retinal glands\nC. localized glands\nD. salivary glands","completion":"salivary glands\nExplanation: The Salivary Glands Many small salivary glands are housed within the mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue. These minor exocrine glands are constantly secreting saliva, either directly into the oral cavity or indirectly through ducts, even while you sleep. In fact, an average of 1 to 1.5 liters of saliva is secreted each day. Usually just enough saliva is present to moisten the mouth and teeth. Secretion increases when you eat, because saliva is essential to moisten food and initiate the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates. Small amounts of saliva are also secreted by the labial glands in the lips. In addition, the buccal glands in the cheeks, palatal glands in the palate, and lingual glands in the tongue help ensure that all areas of the mouth are supplied with adequate saliva."}

{"prompt":"Question: In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and this?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. gas\nC. tissue\nD. Protein","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Characteristics of Amniotes The amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes. In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The albumin, or egg white, provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk is the energy supply for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. However, the eggs of amniotes contain three additional extra-embryonic membranes: the chorion, amnion, and allantois (Figure 29.20). Extra-embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo. While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself, the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac. The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg\u2019s external environment. The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration. The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration. In mammals, membranes that are homologous to the extra-embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta."}

Instead, the thin walls of their tube feet allow oxygen to diffuse in and wastes to diffuse out. Echinoderms also lack a centralized nervous system. They have an open circulatory system and lack a heart. On the other hand, echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and a complete digestive system. Echinoderms use pheromones to communicate with each other. They detect the chemicals with sensory cells on their body surface. Some echinoderms also have simple eyes ( ocelli ) that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms have the ability to regenerate a missing body part."}
{"prompt":"Question: Ionic, covalent, and hydrogen are three important types of what type of interaction between different types of atoms?\nOptions:\n A. forms\nB. conflicts\nC. bonds\nD. levels","completion":"bonds\nExplanation: 2.2 | Chemical Bonds By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Explain the relationship between molecules and compounds \u2022 Distinguish between ions, cations, and anions \u2022 Identify the key difference between ionic and covalent bonds \u2022 Distinguish between nonpolar and polar covalent bonds \u2022 Explain how water molecules link via hydrogen bonds Atoms separated by a great distance cannot link; rather, they must come close enough for the electrons in their valence shells to interact. But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body\u2014or anywhere in the natural world\u2014is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense. Instead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in the same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable\u2014less likely to react again\u2014than its component atoms were when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called molecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is called a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas methane, or CH4. Three types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are used by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important processes. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of the hormone oxytocin during childbirth?\nOptions:\n A. positive feedback\nB. pressure feedback\nC. affirmative feedback\nD. currents feedback","completion":"positive feedback\nExplanation: Labor and Birth Labor is the physical efforts of expulsion of the fetus and the placenta from the uterus during birth (parturition). Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force. There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor. An alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section. This is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to safely deliver the baby."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the two methods in which mutations arise in dna?\nOptions:\n A. induced or spontaneous\nB. produced or spontaneous\nC. accelerated or spontaneous\nD. accelerated or random","completion":"induced or spontaneous\nExplanation: Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body. Mutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure 14.21."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the primary cells of adaptive immune response?\nOptions:\n A. erythrocytes\nB. lymphocytes\nC. red blood cells\nD. white blood cells","completion":"lymphocytes\nExplanation: Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses (Table 21.1). The two basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section. The human body contains approximately 10 12 lymphocytes."}
{"prompt":"Question: What blood pressure reading measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats?\nOptions:\n A. diastolic\nB. metabolic\nC. plasma\nD. systolic","completion":"diastolic\nExplanation: 40.4 | Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe the system of blood flow through the body \u2022 Describe how blood pressure is regulated Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body. Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating. The optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. The optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating, sitting, and standing. Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by one-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself."}

{"prompt":"Question: What reaction is considered the reverse of photosynthesis?\nOptions:\n A. cellular respiration\nB. cellular transfer\nC. cellular decay\nD. cellular digestion","completion":"cellular respiration\nExplanation: Many important biological processes involve redox reactions, which frequently store and release energy. For example, photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into glucose and the oxidation of water into oxygen. This process stores the energy of sunlight in the bonds of sugars. The reverse reaction, cellular respiration, converts the energy in glucose into ATP. Cellular respiration involves the oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and the reduction of oxygen gas to water. This process depends on the reduction of NAD + to the electron carrier NADH, and the reverse oxidation of NADH to NAD + . The reduction of NAD + leads to the formation of a proton (H + ) gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP. NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) are electron carriers in biological systems. The term redox state is often used to describe the balance between NAD + \/NADH and NADP + \/NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Connective tissues typically have three characteristic components in common: cells, large amounts of amorphous ground substance, and what else?\nOptions:\n A. antioxidants\nB. hormones\nC. protein fibers\nD. white blood cells","completion":"protein fibers\nExplanation: 4.3 | Connective Tissue Supports and Protects By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Identify and distinguish between the types of connective tissue: proper, supportive, and fluid \u2022 Explain the functions of connective tissues As may be obvious from its name, one of the major functions of connective tissue is to connect tissues and organs. Unlike epithelial tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no extracellular space in between, connective tissue cells are dispersed in a matrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular material produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the functioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein fibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective tissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells, large amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers. The amount and structure of each component correlates with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground substance in bones supporting the body to the inclusion of specialized cells; for example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs pathogens and also rids tissue of cellular debris."}

Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also be broken down to provide cells with energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: The two complementary strands of what are separated, much like unzipping a zipper, in the initiation phase?\nOptions:\n A. mRNA\nB. dna\nC. Chromosomes\nD. RNA","completion":"dna\nExplanation: Stage 1: Initiation. The two complementary strands are separated, much like unzipping a zipper. Special enzymes, including helicase, untwist and separate the two strands of DNA. Stage 2: Elongation. Each strand becomes a template along which a new complementary strand is built. DNA polymerase brings in the correct bases to complement the template strand, synthesizing a new strand base by base. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that adds free nucleotides to the end of a chain of DNA, making a new double strand. This growing strand continues to be built until it has fully complemented the template strand. Stage 3: Termination. Once the two original strands are bound to their own, finished, complementary strands, DNA replication is stopped and the two new identical DNA molecules are complete. Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term for this mode of replication is \u201csemiconservative,\u201d because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each new DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell\u2019s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism\u2019s DNA, is replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new cells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA replication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene dysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA proofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and corrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the process of cell division later in the chapter."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the special name given to the diffusion of water through the cell membrane?\nOptions:\n A. hemostasis\nB. passive transport\nC. electrolysis\nD. osmosis","completion":"osmosis\nExplanation: If a molecule can pass freely through a cell membrane, it will cross the membrane by diffusion ( Figure below ). The inside of the plasma membrane is hydrophobic, so certain molecules cannot easily pass through the membrane. Recall the semipermeable nature of the lipid bilayer. Molecules that cannot easily pass through the bilayer include ions and small hydrophilic molecules, such as glucose, and macromolecules, including proteins and RNA. Examples of molecules that can easily diffuse across the plasma membrane include carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. These molecules diffuse freely in and out of the cell, along their concentration gradient. Though water is a polar molecule, it can also diffuse through the plasma membrane. The diffusion of water through the cell membrane is of such importance to the cell that it is given a special name, osmosis ."}

Now there are several interactions which begin to occur. One is that the single electrons that each hydrogen atom possesses begin to repel each other. This repulsive force would tend to make the potential energy of the system increase. However, the electron of each atom begins to be attracted to the nucleus of the other atom. This attractive force tends to make the potential energy of the system decrease."}

{"prompt":"Question: Sickle cell disease is caused by production of an abnormal type of what?\nOptions:\n A. fat globule\nB. hemoglobin\nC. thrombocyte\nD. leukocyte","completion":"hemoglobin\nExplanation: down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic. Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs. The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection. An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder in response to the deficit. Blood loss anemias are fairly straightforward. In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms of anemia may be due to ulcers, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and some cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration and gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes. Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells. \u2022 A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell anemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, which delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or crescent) shape, especially at low oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues and causing a variety of serious problems from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which factor causes a cannon ball to move horizontally and then fall on the ground?\nOptions:\n A. cone motion\nB. fluid motion\nC. projectile motion\nD. downward motion","completion":"projectile motion\nExplanation: Earth\u2019s gravity also affects the acceleration of objects that start out moving horizontally, or parallel to the ground. Look at Figure below . A cannon shoots a cannon ball straight ahead, giving the ball horizontal motion. At the same time, gravity pulls the ball down toward the ground. Both forces acting together cause the ball to move in a curved path. This is called projectile motion ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of plants were the first to evolve?\nOptions:\n A. vascular\nB. kilocalorie\nC. nonvascular\nD. cocklebur","completion":"nonvascular\nExplanation: Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve. Compared to other plants, their small size and lack of specialized structures, such as vascular tissue, stems, leaves, or flowers, explains why these plants evolved first. The first nonvascular plants to evolve were the liverworts. The hornworts evolved somewhat later, and mosses apparently evolved last. Of all the bryophytes, mosses are most similar to vascular plants. Presumably, they share the most recent common ancestor with vascular plants."}
{"prompt":"Question: There is a positive correlation between the ability to conduct thermal energy and what other energy, as exemplified by metals?\nOptions:\n A. nuclear\nB. electricity\nC. gravitational\nD. elastic","completion":"electricity\nExplanation: Your feet feel cold as you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in your cold house and then step onto the kitchen tile floor. This result is intriguing, since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The different sensation you feel is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: the heat loss during the same time interval is greater for skin in contact with the tiles than with the carpet, so the temperature drop is greater on the tiles. Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, good conductors of electricity (metals like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are also good heat conductors, whereas insulators of electricity (wood, plastic, and rubber) are poor."}

{"prompt":"Question: Respiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients diseases affecting what part of the body?\nOptions:\n A. lung, heart, and blood vessels\nB. byproduct , heart , and blood vessels\nC. brain, stomach, heart\nD. heart, lungs, stomach","completion":"lung, heart, and blood vessels\nExplanation: Respiratory Therapist Respiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular diseases. They work as part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients. Respiratory therapists may treat premature babies with underdeveloped lungs, patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, or older patients suffering from lung disease such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They may operate advanced equipment such as compressed gas delivery systems, ventilators, blood gas analyzers, and resuscitators. Specialized programs to become a respiratory therapist generally lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree with a respiratory therapist specialty. Because of a growing aging population, career opportunities as a respiratory therapist are expected to remain strong."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the series of changes in the life of an organism?\nOptions:\n A. insect metamorphosis\nB. life cycle\nC. evolution\nD. circle of life","completion":"life cycle\nExplanation: Organisms that have a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults. All diploid adults inherit half of their DNA from each parent. When they are ready to reproduce, diploid reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes. These gametes then fuse through fertilization and produce a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G 1 of the cell cycle. Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated. Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells. Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues. This is the life cycle of humans."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of bond forms by unpaired electrons from two atoms \"matching up\"?\nOptions:\n A. reactive bond\nB. covalent bond\nC. accretion bond\nD. magnetic bond","completion":"covalent bond\nExplanation: You have learned that a covalent bond forms when the electron clouds of two atoms overlap with each other. In a simple H 2 molecule, the single electron in each atom becomes attracted to the nucleus of the other atom in the molecule as the atoms come closer together. An optimum distance, equal to the bond length, is eventually attained, and the potential energy reaches a minimum. A stable, single covalent bond has formed between the two hydrogen atoms. Other covalent bonds form in the same way as unpaired electrons from two atoms \u201cmatch up\u201d to form the bond. In a fluorine atom, there is an unpaired electron in one of the 2p orbitals. When a F 2 molecule forms, the 2p orbitals from each of the two atoms overlap to produce the F\u2212F covalent bond. The overlapping orbitals do not have to be of the same type. In a molecule of HF, the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atom overlaps with the 2p orbital of the fluorine atom (see Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What organ has four ventricles, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube?\nOptions:\n A. brain\nB. heart\nC. liver\nD. bladder","completion":"brain\nExplanation: The Ventricles There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube, the central canal. The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain. The aqueduct opens into the fourth ventricle, which is the space between the cerebellum and the pons and upper medulla (Figure 13.18)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the ends of long bones called?\nOptions:\n A. epiphysis\nB. cartilage\nC. appendage\nD. marrow extension","completion":"epiphysis\nExplanation: Long bones ossify and get longer as they grow and develop. These bones grow from their ends, known as the epiphysis, and the presence of a growth plate, or epiphyseal line, signifies that the bone is still growing."}
{"prompt":"Question: The structural classification of joints divides them into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. the bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue; the three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes, and what?\nOptions:\n A. articular\nB. cartilaginous\nC. synchondrosis\nD. gomphoses","completion":"gomphoses\nExplanation: 38.3 Joints and Skeletal Movement The structural classification of joints divides them into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue; the three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes, and gomphoses. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage; the two types of cartilaginous joints are synchondroses and symphyses. Synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. The functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. Special movements include inversion, eversion, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, pronation, and opposition. Synovial joints are also classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint: planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket."}
{"prompt":"Question: Changes in temperature, ph, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of a protein, leading to loss of function known as what?\nOptions:\n A. digestion\nB. fermentation\nC. bioturbation\nD. denaturation","completion":"denaturation\nExplanation: Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as denaturation. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which organisms capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy inside their cell?\nOptions:\n A. phototrophs\nB. chloroplasts\nC. pores\nD. sporozoans","completion":"phototrophs\nExplanation: Phototrophs are organisms that capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy inside their cell. Most phototrophs are the autotrophs that perform photosynthesis, which are also known as photoautotrophs. These organisms have the ability to fix carbon from carbon dioxide into organic compounds, such as glucose. Chemotrophs , on the other hand, do not get their energy from carbon. These are organisms that break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell through chemosynthesis. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic (chemoautotrophs) or heterotrophic (chemoheterotrophs). Chemoautotrophs derive their energy from chemical reactions, and synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Chemoheterotrophs are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. The various types of metabolisms are discussed in the Prokaryotes: Nutrition and Metabolism (Advanced) concept."}

{"prompt":"Question: Named after the dutch physicist, the van de graaff is a type of what device used for nuclear research?\nOptions:\n A. radiation detector\nB. electromagnetic\nC. barometer\nD. accelerator","completion":"accelerator\nExplanation: Early Accelerators An early accelerator is a relatively simple, large-scale version of the electron gun. The Van de Graaff (named after the Dutch physicist), which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, is a small version of the ones used for nuclear research since their invention for that purpose in 1932. For more, see Figure 33.7. These machines are electrostatic, creating potentials as great as 50 MV, and are used to accelerate a variety of nuclei for a range of experiments. Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles, but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus. Another, equally famous, early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E. Lawrence (1901\u20131958). For a visual representation with more detail, see Figure 33.8. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy and so greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff. Lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in American."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet?\nOptions:\n A. habitat\nB. biodiversity\nC. Allopatric speciation\nD. ecosystem","completion":"biodiversity\nExplanation: Types of Biodiversity Scientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet. Species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and count eukaryotic species in most contexts. Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important for planning how to preserve biodiversity. Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts. Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species. A species\u2019 future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very different types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies. If there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent."}

{"prompt":"Question: Essential minerals that the body needs in tiny quantities are called what?\nOptions:\n A. flux minerals\nB. trace minerals\nC. draw minerals\nD. byproduct minerals","completion":"trace minerals\nExplanation: Food and Drink App: Vitamins and Minerals Vitamins are nutrients that our bodies need in small amounts but cannot synthesize; therefore, they must be obtained from the diet. The word vitamin comes from \u201cvital amine\u201d because it was once thought that all these compounds had an amine group (NH2) in it. This is not actually true, but the name stuck anyway. All vitamins are covalently bonded molecules. Most of them are commonly named with a letter, although all of them also have formal chemical names. Thus vitamin A is also called retinol, vitamin C is called ascorbic acid, and vitamin E is called tocopherol. There is no single vitamin B; there is a group of substances called the B complex vitamins that are all water soluble and participate in cell metabolism. If a diet is lacking in a vitamin, diseases such as scurvy or rickets develop. Luckily, all vitamins are available as supplements, so any dietary deficiency in a vitamin can be easily corrected. A mineral is any chemical element other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen that is needed by the body. Minerals that the body needs in quantity include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine. Essential minerals that the body needs in tiny quantities (so-called trace elements) include manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, selenium, and iodine. Minerals are also obtained from the diet. Interestingly,."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the most common cause of dwarfism?\nOptions:\n A. deformity\nB. achondroplasia\nC. hypothyroidism\nD. retinopathy","completion":"achondroplasia\nExplanation: Whereas cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, and phenylketonuria are all autosomal recessive disorders, achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism in humans. Achondroplasia is a result of an autosomal dominant mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene 3 (FGFR3), which causes an abnormality of cartilage formation. FGFR3 normally has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active (constantly \u201cturned on\u201d) and this leads to severely shortened bones. Individuals with achondroplasia are heterozygous for the mutation (one mutant copy, one normal copy). Homozygous for the achondroplasia mutation is lethal prior to birth or shortly after birth."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food?\nOptions:\n A. jaw\nB. tooth\nC. neck\nD. throat","completion":"jaw\nExplanation: Gnathostomes: Jawed Fishes Gnathostomes or \u201cjaw-mouths\u201d are vertebrates that possess jaws. One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw, which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. The evolution of jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit food resources that were unavailable to jawless fishes. Early gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately. Pectoral fins are typically located on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior. Evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to expand from the sedentary suspension feeding of jawless fishes to become mobile predators. The ability of gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources likely is one reason that they replaced most jawless fishes during the Devonian period. Two early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms (Figure 29.10), which arose in the late Silurian period and are now extinct. Most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes."}

Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear. The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are the malleus (also known as the hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches called?\nOptions:\n A. adaptation\nB. learned behavior\nC. adaptive radiation\nD. spontaneous mutation","completion":"adaptive radiation\nExplanation: After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct. With new habitats available, some species will adapt to the new environments. Evolutionary processes act rapidly during these times. Many new species evolve to fill those available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation . At the end of this period of rapid evolution, the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction. One example came after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form. Although they lived in the habitats the dinosaurs had lived in, they didn't look much like the dinosaurs."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which rule is a result of trends in energies and is useful in explaining why atoms form the ions that they do?\nOptions:\n A. electrons rule\nB. nutron rule\nC. octet rule\nD. coupling rule","completion":"octet rule\nExplanation: valence shell is called the octet rule. When atoms form compounds, the octet rule is not always satisfied for all atoms at all times, but it is a very good rule of thumb for understanding the kinds of bonding arrangements that atoms can make. It is not impossible to violate the octet rule. Consider sodium: in its elemental form, it has one valence electron and is stable. It is rather reactive, however, and does not require a lot of energy to remove that electron to make the Na+ ion. We could remove another electron by adding even more energy to the ion, to make the Na2+ ion. However, that requires much more energy than is normally available in chemical reactions, so sodium stops at a 1+ charge after losing a single electron. It turns out that the Na+ ion has a complete octet in its new valence shell, the n = 2 shell, which satisfies the octet rule. The octet rule is a result of trends in energies and is useful in explaining why atoms form the ions that they do. Now consider an Na atom in the presence of a Cl atom. The two atoms have these Lewis electron dot diagrams and electron configurations:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to refer to the external female reproductive structures collectively?\nOptions:\n A. cervix\nB. vagina\nC. vulva\nD. uterus","completion":"vulva\nExplanation: External Female Genitals The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively as the vulva (Figure 27.10). The mons pubis is a pad of fat that is located at the anterior, over the pubic bone. After puberty, it becomes covered in pubic hair. The labia majora (labia = \u201clips\u201d; majora = \u201clarger\u201d) are folds of hair-covered skin that begin just posterior to the mons pubis. The thinner and more pigmented labia minora (labia = \u201clips\u201d; minora = \u201csmaller\u201d) extend medial to the labia majora. Although they naturally vary in shape and size from woman to woman, the labia minora serve to protect the female urethra and the entrance to the female reproductive tract. The superior, anterior portions of the labia minora come together to encircle the clitoris (or glans clitoris), an organ that originates from the same cells as the glans penis and has abundant nerves that make it important in sexual sensation and orgasm. The hymen is a thin membrane that sometimes partially covers the entrance to the vagina. An intact hymen cannot be used as an indication of \u201cvirginity\u201d; even at birth, this is only a partial membrane, as menstrual fluid and other secretions must be able to exit the body, regardless of penile\u2013vaginal intercourse. The vaginal opening is located between the opening of the urethra and the anus. It is flanked by outlets to the Bartholin\u2019s glands (or greater vestibular glands)."}

{"prompt":"Question: The word antibiotic comes from the greek anti, meaning \u201cagainst,\u201d and bios, meaning this?\nOptions:\n A. bacteria\nB. life\nC. germ\nD. virus","completion":"life\nExplanation: The Antibiotic Crisis The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti, meaning \u201cagainst,\u201d and bios, meaning \u201clife. \u201d An antibiotic is an organismproduced chemical that is hostile to the growth of other organisms. Today\u2019s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis. Are antibiotics that were used to treat bacterial infections easily treatable in the past becoming obsolete? Are there new \u201csuperbugs\u201d\u2014bacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics? Is this the beginning of the end of antibiotics? All of these questions challenge the healthcare community. One of the main reasons for resistant bacteria is the overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics, such as not completing a full course of prescribed antibiotics. The incorrect use of an antibiotic results in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria. The antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria, and therefore only the resistant forms remain. These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of resistant forms over non-resistant ones. Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock. The routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. In the United States, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to animals. The antibiotics are not used to prevent disease, but to enhance production of their products."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are materials that are poor thermal conductors called?\nOptions:\n A. pollution insulators\nB. sunlight insulators\nC. warmth insulators\nD. thermal insulators","completion":"thermal insulators\nExplanation: Particles of gases are farther apart and have fewer collisions, so they are not good at transferring thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called thermal insulators . Figure below shows several examples. Fluffy yellow insulation inside the roof of a home is full of air. The air prevents the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and out of the house on cold days. A puffy down jacket keeps you warm in the winter for the same reason. Its feather filling holds trapped air that prevents energy transfer from your warm body to the cold air outside. Solids like plastic and wood are also good thermal insulators. That\u2019s why pot handles and cooking utensils are often made of these materials."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe changes to an organism\u2019s dna and are an important driver of diversity in populations?\nOptions:\n A. mutations\nB. adaptations\nC. pathogens\nD. evolutions","completion":"mutations\nExplanation: Mutation Mutations are changes to an organism\u2019s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of tissue transports water, nutrients, and food in plants?\nOptions:\n A. vascular tissue\nB. rough tissue\nC. normal tissue\nD. smooth tissue","completion":"vascular tissue\nExplanation: A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed."}

{"prompt":"Question: The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the what?\nOptions:\n A. atomic mass\nB. ionic mass\nC. nucleus mass\nD. molecular mass","completion":"molecular mass\nExplanation: Summary 3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each atom represented in the chemical formula and is expressed in atomic mass units. The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 \u00d7 1023, a quantity called Avogadro\u2019s number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass. Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g\/mol) for any substance are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately 18 g). 3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compound\u2019s percent composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compound\u2019s empirical formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to the compound\u2019s molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula. 3.3 Molarity Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after dilution. 3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution components\u2019 masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of flexion is the bending of the neck or body toward the right or left side?\nOptions:\n A. lateral\nB. orbital\nC. cylindrical\nD. ventral","completion":"lateral\nExplanation: Flexion and Extension Flexion and extension are movements that take place within the sagittal plane and involve anterior or posterior movements of the body or limbs. For the vertebral column, flexion (anterior flexion) is an anterior (forward) bending of the neck or body, while extension involves a posterior-directed motion, such as straightening from a flexed position or bending backward. Lateral flexion is the bending of the neck or body toward the right or left side. These movements of the vertebral column involve both the symphysis joint formed by each intervertebral disc, as well as the plane type of synovial joint formed between the inferior articular processes of one vertebra and the superior articular processes of the next lower vertebra. In the limbs, flexion decreases the angle between the bones (bending of the joint), while extension increases the angle and straightens the joint. For the upper limb, all anterior-going motions are flexion and all posterior-going motions are extension."}

{"prompt":"Question: What instrument, with a digital readout, is used by scientists to measure very small masses?\nOptions:\n A. mixed balance\nB. electronic balance\nC. mechanical balance\nD. common balance","completion":"electronic balance\nExplanation: To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure below . This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray. The mass of the tray alone would have to be measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together. The difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a natural situation which arises to physically divide organisms?\nOptions:\n A. vicariance\nB. assimilation\nC. reproduction\nD. extinction","completion":"vicariance\nExplanation: If the two isolated populations are brought back together and the hybrid offspring that formed from matings between individuals of the two populations have lower survivorship or reduced fertility, then selection will favor individuals that are able to discriminate between potential mates of their own population and the other population. This selection will enhance the reproductive isolation. Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: from a river forming a new branch, erosion forming a new valley, or a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, such as seeds floating over the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are that individuals from each population would fly back and forth, continuing gene flow. However, if two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely. Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories. If a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, this is called dispersal. If a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms, this is called vicariance. Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of the United States, two separate subspecies of spotted owls exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative, the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (Figure 11.15). The cause of their initial separation is not clear, but it may have been caused by the glaciers of the ice age dividing an initial population into [5] two."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of pressure may build up inside the cell when water moves into a cell by osmosis?\nOptions:\n A. pleasurable pressure\nB. osmotic pressure\nC. impervious pressure\nD. transverse pressure","completion":"osmotic pressure\nExplanation: When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure may build up inside the cell. If a cell has a cell wall, the wall helps maintain the cell\u2019s water balance. Osmotic pressure is the main cause of support in many plants. When a plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the cell. At this point the plant cell is turgid ( Figure below ). The effects of osmotic pressures on plant cells are shown in Figure above ."}

Production of all leukocytes begins in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins. Secondary production and maturation of lymphocytes occurs in specific regions of lymphatic tissue known as germinal centers. Lymphocytes are fully capable of mitosis and may produce clones of cells with identical properties. This capacity enables an individual to maintain immunity throughout life to many threats that have been encountered in the past."}
{"prompt":"Question: Along with changes in the shape of the resonant cavity, growth of what organ in pubescent boys leads to the difference in predominant frequencies in speech between men and women?\nOptions:\n A. pharynx\nB. trachea\nC. larynx\nD. esoophagus","completion":"larynx\nExplanation: The fundamental and overtones can be present simultaneously in a variety of combinations. For example, middle C on a trumpet has a sound distinctively different from middle C on a clarinet, both instruments being modified versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different and subject to shading by the musician. This mix is what gives various musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns, strings, sounding boxes, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones. Simple resonant cavities can be made to resonate with the sound of the vowels, for example. (See Figure 17.30. ) In boys, at puberty, the larynx grows and the shape of the resonant cavity changes giving rise to the difference in predominant frequencies in speech between men and women."}

{"prompt":"Question: Fertilization occurs when what material from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower?\nOptions:\n A. ova\nB. pollen\nC. nitrogen\nD. sperm","completion":"pollen\nExplanation: Pea plants reproduce sexually. The male gametes are released by tiny grains of pollen. The female gametes lie deep within the flowers. Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower. This is called pollination . Mendel was able to control which plants pollinated each other. He transferred pollen by hand from flower to flower."}
{"prompt":"Question: How do mammals generate heat?\nOptions:\n A. running around fast\nB. eating spicy foods\nC. maintaning low metabolism\nD. maintaining high metabolism","completion":"maintaining high metabolism\nExplanation: Mammals generate heat mainly by maintaining a high rate of metabolism. Compared with the cells of other animals, the cells of mammals have more mitochondria. Mitochondria are the cell organelles that generate energy. Mammals may also produce little bursts of heat by shivering. Shivering occurs when many muscles all contract slightly at the same time. The muscle contractions generate a small amount of heat."}

Rock units are shown in a color identified in a key. On the geologic map of the Grand Canyon, for example, different rock types are shown in different colors. Some people call the Grand Canyon \u201clayer cake geology\u201c because most of the rock units are in layers. Rock units show up on both sides of a stream valley."}
{"prompt":"Question: Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with what?\nOptions:\n A. fuel\nB. carbon\nC. coal\nD. iron","completion":"iron\nExplanation: Reaction with Elements Oxygen reacts directly at room temperature or at elevated temperatures with all other elements except the noble gases, the halogens, and few second- and third-row transition metals of low reactivity (those with higher reduction potentials than copper). Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with iron. The more active metals form peroxides or superoxides. Less active metals and the nonmetals give oxides. Two examples of these reactions are: 2Mg(s) + O 2(g) \u27f6 2MgO(s) P 4(s) + 5O 2(g) \u27f6 P 4 O 10(s) The oxides of halogens, at least one of the noble gases, and metals with higher reduction potentials than copper do not form by the direct action of the elements with oxygen."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do all respiratory diseases affect?\nOptions:\n A. liquid exchange process\nB. helium exchange process\nC. transit exchange process\nD. gas exchange process","completion":"gas exchange process\nExplanation: Reproduction Fungi reproduce sexually and\/or asexually. Perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while the so-called imperfect fungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis). In both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal. Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds. The giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores. The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth (Figure 24.6)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the collective travel of sheep known as?\nOptions:\n A. gaggle\nB. load\nC. den\nD. herd","completion":"herd\nExplanation: Like many other animals, sheep travel in herds. The tendency is for each individual sheep to stay with the herd. However, a sheep may sometimes wander off, depending on how strong the attraction is for a particular food or water supply. At other times, a sheep may become frightened and run off. Whether a sheep chooses to stay with the herd or go its own way depends on the balance between attraction to the herd and attraction to the outside influence."}

You probably add ice cubes to it, as in the Figure below . You might think that the ice cools down the cola, but in fact, it works the other way around. The warm cola heats up the ice. Thermal energy from the warm cola is transferred to the much colder ice, causing it to melt. The cola loses thermal energy in the process, so its temperature falls."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the contacts between neurons called?\nOptions:\n A. neurapses\nB. impulses\nC. electrodes\nD. synapses","completion":"synapses\nExplanation: 12.5 Communication Between Neurons The basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the action potential that propagates down the axon. For a neuron to generate an action potential, it needs to receive input from another source, either another neuron or a sensory stimulus. That input will result in opening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a graded potential based on the strength of the stimulus. Graded potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the probability of the neuron reaching threshold. Graded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli. If the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a generator potential because it can directly generate the action potential in the initial segment of the axon. If the sensory stimulus is received by a specialized sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a receptor potential. Graded potentials produced by interactions between neurons at synapses are called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an inhibitory PSP. Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which can either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical synapses are far more common. At a chemical synapse, neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses across the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the PSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is limited in time. The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based on the neurotransmitter system produced by that neuron. The cholinergic system is found at the neuromuscular junction and in certain places within the nervous system. Amino acids, such as glutamate, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are used as neurotransmitters. Other neurotransmitters are the result of amino acids being enzymatically changed, as in the biogenic amines, or being covalently bonded together, as in the neuropeptides."}

{"prompt":"Question: What cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces?\nOptions:\n A. epithelial cells\nB. mast cells\nC. nerve cells\nD. connective tissue","completion":"epithelial cells\nExplanation: The Epithelial Cell Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface. Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the intersection point of the critical temperature and the critical pressure called?\nOptions:\n A. instance point\nB. basic juncture\nC. critical point\nD. peak point","completion":"critical point\nExplanation: Refer again to water\u2019s phase diagram ( Figure above ). Notice point E, labeled the critical point . What does that mean? At 373.99\u00b0C, particles of water in the gas phase are moving very, very rapidly. At any temperature higher than that, the gas phase cannot be made to liquefy, no matter how much pressure is applied to the gas. The critical pressure (P c ) is the pressure that must be applied to the gas at the critical temperature in order to turn it into a liquid. For water, the critical pressure is very high, 217.75 atm. The critical point is the intersection point of the critical temperature and the critical pressure."}
{"prompt":"Question: Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of what, resulting in a signal for a phagocyte to destroy them?\nOptions:\n A. pathogen\nB. antigen\nC. adhesion\nD. immunogen","completion":"antigen\nExplanation: B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen , a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure below ). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process."}
{"prompt":"Question: Free atoms are spherical in shape, so the relative sizes of the elements can be compared by looking at each atom's atomic what?\nOptions:\n A. weight\nB. axis\nC. radius\nD. angles","completion":"radius\nExplanation: One important characteristic that determines the way in which elements behave is the total size of each atom. Free atoms are spherical in shape, so the relative sizes of the elements can be compared by looking at each atom's atomic radius , which is the distance from an atom's nucleus to the electrons in the outermost orbitals. You might expect atoms to generally grow larger as they go up in atomic number (which is equal to the total number of electrons in the neutral atom). Indeed, if you look at a single group of the periodic table, this trend holds true. Iodine is larger than bromine, which is in turn larger than chlorine and fluorine. In the case of a single group, each successive row places electrons in a higher principal energy level. Since higher energy levels are farther from the nucleus on average, this results in a larger total volume occupied by the atom."}
{"prompt":"Question: If the amount of force of that is applied is increased, what happens to the work that a machine is producing?\nOptions:\n A. it's unchanged\nB. it is easier\nC. it is harder\nD. it's variable","completion":"it is easier\nExplanation: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a mass spectrometer used to measure?\nOptions:\n A. partial atomic masses\nB. relative atomic masses\nC. subatomic masses\nD. optical atomic masses","completion":"relative atomic masses\nExplanation: Although the masses of the electron, the proton, and the neutron are known to a high degree of precision (Table 1.3 \"Properties of Subatomic Particles*\"), the mass of any given atom is not simply the sum of the masses of its electrons, protons, and neutrons. For example, the ratio of the masses of 1H (hydrogen) and 2H (deuterium) is actually 0.500384, rather than 0.49979 as predicted from the numbers of neutrons and protons present. Although the difference in mass is small, it is extremely important because it is the source of the huge amounts of energy released in nuclear reactions (Chapter 20 \"Nuclear Chemistry\"). Because atoms are much too small to measure individually and do not have a charge, there is no convenient way to accurately measure absolute atomic masses. Scientists can measure relative atomic masses very accurately, however, using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. The technique is conceptually similar to the one Thomson used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called ions. When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomson\u2019s experiment. The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. By measuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientists can determine their relative masses (Figure 1.25 \"Determining Relative Atomic Masses Using a Mass Spectrometer\"). Thus it is not possible to calculate absolute atomic masses accurately by simply adding together the masses of the electrons, the protons, and the neutrons, and absolute atomic masses cannot be measured, but relative masses can be measured very accurately. It is actually rather common in chemistry to encounter a quantity whose magnitude can be measured only relative to some other quantity, rather than absolutely. We will encounter many other examples later in this text. In such cases,."}
{"prompt":"Question: Acids and bases are important in living things because what proteins typically can perform their job only at a certain level of acidity?\nOptions:\n A. hormones\nB. enzymes\nC. vitamins\nD. catalysts","completion":"enzymes\nExplanation: Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can do their job only at a certain level of acidity. Cells secrete acids and bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work. For example, every time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive system. Consider the acidic environment of the stomach. The acidic environment helps with the digestion of food. The enzyme pepsin, which helps break down proteins in the stomach can only function optimally in the low pH environment. The stomach secretes a strong acid that allows pepsin to work, and the stomach to do its job. However, when stomach contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized. This is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in order to work. An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid."}

{"prompt":"Question: Air quality is a measure of what in the air?\nOptions:\n A. pollutants\nB. clouds\nC. gases\nD. water","completion":"pollutants\nExplanation: Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. Factories burned coal for energy. Gasoline burned by cars and trucks added greatly to air pollution. By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad. Incidents in London and in U. S. cities alerted people to the extent of the problem. It was clear that air quality needed to be protected."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are materials that are good conductors of thermal energy called?\nOptions:\n A. thermal conductors\nB. reflective conductors\nC. atmospheric conductors\nD. geospatial conductors","completion":"thermal conductors\nExplanation: Conduction is usually faster in liquids and certain solids than in gases. Materials that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors . Metals are excellent thermal conductors. They have freely moving electrons that can transfer energy quickly and easily. That\u2019s why the metal pot in Figure above soon gets hot all over, even though it gains thermal energy from the fire only at the bottom of the pot. In Figure below , the metal heating element of the curling iron heats up almost instantly and quickly transfers energy to the strands of hair that it touches."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the leading cause of death worldwide?\nOptions:\n A. lung disease\nB. cancer\nC. coronary artery disease\nD. liver failure","completion":"coronary artery disease\nExplanation: Heart: Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. It occurs when the buildup of plaque\u2014a fatty material including cholesterol, connective tissue, white blood cells, and some smooth muscle cells\u2014within the walls of the arteries obstructs the flow of blood and decreases the flexibility or compliance of the vessels. This condition is called atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries that involves the accumulation of plaque. As the coronary blood vessels become occluded, the flow of blood to the tissues will be restricted, a condition called ischemia that causes the cells to receive insufficient amounts of oxygen, called hypoxia. Figure 19.16 shows the blockage of coronary arteries highlighted by the injection of dye. Some individuals with coronary artery disease report pain radiating from the chest called angina pectoris, but others remain asymptomatic. If untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to MI or a heart attack."}

{"prompt":"Question: Amino acids are the building blocks of what macromolecules?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. lipids\nC. sugars\nD. carbohydrates","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: 3.4 Proteins Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids. Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain. There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the R group. Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. The local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the \u03b1 helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure. The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure. When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function."}

{"prompt":"Question: What form when a single atom gains or loses electrons?\nOptions:\n A. monatomic ions\nB. fusional ions\nC. vacuoles ions\nD. carbon atoms","completion":"monatomic ions\nExplanation: Monatomic ions form when a single atom gains or loses electrons. For the main group elements, cations are generally formed by removing all of the valence electrons from the atom. Since the numbers of valence electrons for the representative elements are constant within a particular group, all we need is the group number of a given element to know its charge when it becomes a cation. Group 1 elements form ions with a 1+ charge, Group 2 metal ions have a 2+ charge, and the ions of Group 13 elements tend to have a 3+ charge. Heavier p-block metals such as tin and lead are special cases and will be discussed with the transition metal ions. The name of a monatomic cation is the same as the name of the neutral element. For example, the sodium atom (Na) loses a single electron to form the sodium ion (Na + ), while Al 3+ is an aluminum ion."}

The California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides. Wet soil becomes slippery and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides. The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start sliding."}
{"prompt":"Question: Radiometric dating methods, such as carbon-14 dating depend on what type of decay?\nOptions:\n A. microwave\nB. carbon\nC. radioactive\nD. nuclear","completion":"radioactive\nExplanation: The age of a rock in years is its absolute age. The main evidence for absolute age comes from radiometric dating methods, such as carbon-14 dating. These methods depend on radioactive decay."}
{"prompt":"Question: What has a distinct front and back end?\nOptions:\n A. hydro sphere\nB. heroclix sphere\nC. imipenem sphere\nD. volvox sphere","completion":"volvox sphere\nExplanation: The Volvox sphere has a distinct front and back end. The colony of cells can swim in a coordinated fashion. The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony to swim towards light."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does the thymus gland produce?\nOptions:\n A. b cells\nB. insulin\nC. t cells\nD. hormones","completion":"t cells\nExplanation: Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections. The spleen\u2019s main function is to filter the blood. The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: Evidence for the presence of what on mars makes scientists think that life might have existed there in the past?\nOptions:\n A. water\nB. gas\nC. plasma\nD. air","completion":"water\nExplanation: Curiosity, the rover, has found evidence of a flowing stream on Mars. Layers of smooth, water-polished pebbles have been photographed. This is exactly what you would see in a stream on Earth. There are many surface features that look like water-eroded canyons. Since there was liquid water on Mars, scientists think that life might have existed there in the past. One of Curiosity's tasks is to sample the soil to search for carbon and other evidence of life."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of respiration has the advantage of releasing more energy?\nOptions:\n A. aerobic\nB. kinetic\nC. anaerobic\nD. elastic","completion":"aerobic\nExplanation: A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Without oxygen, organisms can split glucose into just two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage?\nOptions:\n A. hormonal tissue\nB. adipose tissue\nC. metabolism tissue\nD. somatic tissue","completion":"adipose tissue\nExplanation: Adipose Tissue Adipose tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage. One important example is leptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels of body fat. Leptin is released in response to food consumption and acts by binding to brain neurons involved in energy intake and expenditure. Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing appetite. It also appears that the binding of leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of cortical bone. Adiponectin\u2014another hormone synthesized by adipose cells\u2014appears to reduce cellular insulin resistance and to protect blood vessels from inflammation and atherosclerosis. Its levels are lower in people who are obese, and rise following weight loss."}
{"prompt":"Question: What speeds up the reactions of chemical digestion?\nOptions:\n A. protein catalysts\nB. electrical enzymes\nC. stomach acids\nD. digestive enzymes","completion":"digestive enzymes\nExplanation: Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive enzymes and other substances secreted into the GI tract. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up a biochemical reaction. Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion. Table below lists a few digestive enzymes, the organs that produce them, and their functions in digestion."}
{"prompt":"Question: What organ is the hypothalamus a part of?\nOptions:\n A. Nervous system\nB. liver\nC. heart\nD. brain","completion":"brain\nExplanation: The hypothalamus is actually part of the brain (see Figure below ), but it also secretes hormones. Some of its hormones that \u201ctell\u201d the pituitary gland to either secrete or stop secreting its hormones. In this way, the hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems. The hypothalamus also produces hormones that directly regulate body processes. These hormones travel to the pituitary gland, which stores them until they are needed. The hormones include antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin."}
{"prompt":"Question: Are valence electrons attracted more or less strongly when they are farther from the nucleus?\nOptions:\n A. equally\nB. more strongly\nC. differently\nD. less strongly","completion":"less strongly\nExplanation: The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group. That\u2019s because the atoms get bigger from the top to the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. When valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom. This makes the atom more reactive."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where do lightnings build up?\nOptions:\n A. stratosphere\nB. air\nC. clouds\nD. troposphere","completion":"clouds\nExplanation: Lightning is the discharge of static electricity that has built up on clouds. Every year, the earth experiences an average of 25 million lightning strikes. Lightning bolts travel at speeds up to 60,000 miles per second, and can reach temperatures of 50,000\u00b0F, which is five times the temperature of the surface of the sun. The energy contained in a single lightning strike could light a 100 Watt light bulb 24 hours per day for 90 days."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where are protons and neutrons located?\nOptions:\n A. radius\nB. nucleus\nC. electron shell\nD. epidermis","completion":"nucleus\nExplanation: Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the nucleus. The Figure below is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which organ is the control center of the nervous system?\nOptions:\n A. the heart\nB. the spine\nC. the brain\nD. the lungs","completion":"the brain\nExplanation: What weighs about three pounds and contains up to 100 billion cells? The answer is the human brain. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It\u2019s like the pilot of a plane. It tells other parts of the nervous system what to do."}
{"prompt":"Question: In which state of matter do particles take the shape of their container, but cannot expand to fill it?\nOptions:\n A. gas\nB. mixture\nC. chemical\nD. liquid","completion":"liquid\nExplanation: A liquid is a state of matter in which particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, the particles cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container."}
{"prompt":"Question: Cilia and flagella are generally associated with what function in organisms, whether the function is internal or external?\nOptions:\n A. digestion\nB. reproduction\nC. sight\nD. movement","completion":"movement\nExplanation: Cilia ( cilium , singular) are made up of microtubule containing extensions of the cell membrane. Although both cilia and flagella are used for movement, cilia are much shorter than flagella. Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled organisms, such as paramecium. Their cilia beat together to move the little animal-like protists through the water. In multicellular animals, including humans, cilia are usually found in large numbers on a single surface of cells. Multicellular animals' cilia usually move materials inside the body. For example, the mucociliary escalator of the respiratory system is made up of mucus-secreting ciliated cells that line the trachea and bronchi. These ciliated cells, shown in Figure below , move mucus away from the lungs. This mucus catches spores, bacteria, and debris and moves to the esophagus, where it is swallowed."}
{"prompt":"Question: The contents of which organ are mixed every 20 seconds?\nOptions:\n A. the metabolism\nB. pancreas\nC. kidney\nD. the stomach","completion":"the stomach"}
{"prompt":"Question: What do cells do in order to replace damaged or worn out cells?\nOptions:\n A. replicate\nB. die\nC. fold\nD. divide","completion":"divide\nExplanation: Cells also divide in order to replace damaged or worn-out cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: In which part of a bird stomach is food stored, soaked and mechanically ground?\nOptions:\n A. pancreas\nB. digestion\nC. gizzard\nD. Gall bladder","completion":"gizzard\nExplanation: Avian Birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive system, shown in Figure 34.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the proventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the gizzard, where the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated. Most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca."}
{"prompt":"Question: Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to tumors and what disease?\nOptions:\n A. vascular disease\nB. cirrhosis\nC. kidney failure\nD. cancer","completion":"cancer\nExplanation: 10.4 | Cancer and the Cell Cycle By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth \u2022 Understand how proto-oncogenes are normal cell genes that, when mutated, become oncogenes \u2022 Describe how tumor suppressors function \u2022 Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (\u201c-oma\u201d) can result."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of resource is limited in supply and cannot be replaced except over millions of years?\nOptions:\n A. capital resources\nB. renewable energy\nC. human resources\nD. natural resource","completion":"natural resource\nExplanation: Natural resource that is limited in supply and cannot be replaced except over millions of years."}
{"prompt":"Question: Predicting the possible genotypes and phenotypes from a genetic cross is often aided by a what?\nOptions:\n A. balusters square\nB. dinobot square\nC. axle square\nD. punnett square","completion":"punnett square\nExplanation: Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to scientifically predict what would result. Predicting the possible genotypes and phenotypes from a genetic cross is often aided by a Punnett square."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of physics explains the behavior of visible light and electromagnetic waves?\nOptions:\n A. Quantum mechanics\nB. Thermodynamics\nC. statistics\nD. optics","completion":"optics\nExplanation: We already know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic waves to which our eyes respond. That knowledge still leaves many questions regarding the nature of light and vision. What is color, and how do our eyes detect it? Why do diamonds sparkle? How does light travel? How do lenses and mirrors form images? These are but a few of the questions that are answered by the study of optics. Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of visible light and other electromagnetic waves. In particular, optics is concerned with the generation and propagation of light and its interaction with matter. What we have already learned about the generation of light in our study of heat transfer by radiation will be expanded upon in later topics, especially those on atomic physics. Now, we will concentrate on the propagation of light and its interaction with matter. It is convenient to divide optics into two major parts based on the size of objects that light encounters. When light interacts with an object that is several times as large as the light\u2019s wavelength, its observable behavior is like that of a ray; it does not prominently display its wave characteristics. We call this part of optics \u201cgeometric optics. \u201d This chapter will concentrate on such situations. When light interacts with smaller objects, it has very prominent wave characteristics, such as constructive and destructive interference. Wave Optics will concentrate on such situations."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the general composition of the continental crust?\nOptions:\n A. limestone\nB. marble\nC. granite\nD. sandstone","completion":"granite\nExplanation: The average composition of continental crust is granite."}
{"prompt":"Question: Prokaryotes and the nitrogen cycle nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and this?\nOptions:\n A. nucleic acids\nB. nuclear forces\nC. nerve cells\nD. molecules","completion":"nucleic acids\nExplanation: Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle Nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. It is a macronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad processes, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes. As illustrated in Figure 22.19, prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or \u201cfixed\u201d into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation. Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms. Another source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as N2 and N2O. Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N2 as the final product. Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira. The bacteria performs the reverse process, the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O, NO, and N2, a process called denitrification."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the addition of oxygen to a molecule or the removal of hydrogen from a molecule called?\nOptions:\n A. precipitation\nB. evaporation\nC. oxidation\nD. ionization","completion":"oxidation\nExplanation: Oxidation can be defined as the addition of oxygen to a molecule or the removal of hydrogen from a molecule. When an alkane is heated in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, it can be oxidized to the corresponding alkene in a reaction called a dehydrogenation reaction. Two hydrogen atoms are removed in the process. The alkene can be further oxidized to an alkyne by the removal of two more hydrogen atoms."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the molecule, dipeptide formed together by?\nOptions:\n A. polymer acids\nB. amino acids\nC. rna acids\nD. acetic acids","completion":"amino acids\nExplanation: Amino acids join together to form a molecule called a dipeptide. The \u2013OH from the carboxyl group of one amino acid combines with a hydrogen atom from the amino group of the other amino acid to produce water (blue)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the transfer of heat by a current?\nOptions:\n A. radiation\nB. convection\nC. combustion\nD. diffusion","completion":"convection\nExplanation: Convection is the transfer of heat by a current. Convection happens in a liquid or a gas. Air near the ground is warmed by heat radiating from Earth's surface. The warm air is less dense, so it rises. As it rises, it cools. The cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface. This creates a convection current, like the one in Figure below . Convection is the most important way that heat travels in the atmosphere."}
{"prompt":"Question: Snails, scallops, and squids are what type of invertebrate?\nOptions:\n A. mollusk\nB. crustacean\nC. algae\nD. arthropod","completion":"mollusk\nExplanation: Mollusks are invertebrates such as snails, scallops, and squids. They have a hard outer shell. There is a layer of tissue called the mantle between the shell and the body. Most mollusks have tentacles for feeding and sensing, and many have a muscular foot. Mollusks also have a coelom, a complete digestive system, and specialized organs for excretion. The majority of mollusks live in the ocean. Different classes of mollusks have different ways of obtaining food."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of energy travels in waves across space as well as through matter?\nOptions:\n A. kinetic energy\nB. mechanical radiation\nC. thermal energy\nD. electromagnetic radiation","completion":"electromagnetic radiation\nExplanation: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: How is population density expressed?\nOptions:\n A. per arable land\nB. number per household\nC. arable land per capita\nD. number per area","completion":"number per area\nExplanation: Ecologists look at many factors that help to describe a population. First, ecologists can measure the number of individuals that make up the population, known as population size . They can then determine the population density , which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area. Population density can be expressed as number per area , such as 20 mice\/acre, or 50 rabbits\/square mile."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the main component of paper, cardboard, and textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant fibers?\nOptions:\n A. cellulose\nB. pulp\nC. cambium\nD. vascular tissue","completion":"cellulose\nExplanation: Cellulose is another polymer of glucose, consisting of anywhere from hundreds to over ten thousand monomers. It is the structural component of the cell walls of green plants and is the single most common organic molecule on Earth. Roughly 33% of all plant matter is cellulose. The linkage structure in cellulose is different than that of starch, and cellulose is indigestible except by a few microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of cattle and termites. The figure below shows a triple strand of cellulose. There is no branching and the fibers adopt a very stiff rod-like structure with numerous hydrogen bonds between the fibers adding to its strength. Cellulose is the main component of paper, cardboard, and textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant fibers."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of science is the study of matter and energy and includes chemistry and physics?\nOptions:\n A. biology\nB. physical science\nC. Earth science\nD. genetics","completion":"physical science\nExplanation: Physical science is the study of matter and energy. It includes chemistry and physics."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the muscular organ shaped like an upside-down pear that has a thick lining of tissues called the endometrium?\nOptions:\n A. kidney\nB. uterus\nC. lungs\nD. liver","completion":"uterus\nExplanation: The uterus is a muscular organ shaped like an upside-down pear. It has a thick lining of tissues called the endometrium . The lower, narrower end of the uterus is known as the cervix . The uterus is where a fetus grows and develops until birth. During pregnancy, the uterus can expand greatly to make room for the baby as it grows. During birth, contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus push the baby through the cervix and out of the body."}
{"prompt":"Question: Lava that enters the water is called what?\nOptions:\n A. lava flow\nB. magma runoff\nC. pillow lava\nD. saltwater lava","completion":"pillow lava\nExplanation: Pillow lava is created from lava that enters the water. The volcanic vent may be underwater. The lava may flow over land and enter the water ( Figure below ). Once in the water, the lava cools very quickly. The lava forms round rocks that resemble pillows. Pillow lava is particularly common along mid-ocean ridges."}

{"prompt":"Question: What group of gases are unusually unreactive?\nOptions:\n A. volcanic gases\nB. greenhouse gases\nC. halogens\nD. noble gases","completion":"noble gases\nExplanation: Nonmetals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions and have a high attraction to electrons within a compound. The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Since the noble gases are an unusually unreactive group, the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. It is also not found in nature as a free element. Fluorine gas reacts explosively with many other elements and compounds and is considered to be one of the most dangerous known substances."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the smallest particles of elements that maintain their unique properties?\nOptions:\n A. protons\nB. molecules\nC. atoms\nD. electrons","completion":"atoms\nExplanation: A: The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn\u2019t mean that we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements. Also, it is atoms\u2014not particles of atoms\u2014that combine in fixed proportions in compounds. Instead of throwing out Dalton\u2019s theory, scientists have refined and expanded on it."}
{"prompt":"Question: Zoonotic pathogens are transferred from what to what?\nOptions:\n A. animals to humans\nB. humans to animals\nC. animals to animals\nD. humans to humans","completion":"animals to humans"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the change in a species over time?\nOptions:\n A. variation\nB. evolution\nC. phenomenon\nD. transformation","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: Scientists do the same thing when they classify , or put into categories, living things. Scientists classify organisms not only by their physical features, but also by how closely related they are. Lions and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears, but are lions and tigers related? Evolutionarily speaking, yes. Evolution is the change in a species over time. Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor. So it turns out that the two cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears. How an organism looks and how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified."}
{"prompt":"Question: The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes make up about 25% of all of what?\nOptions:\n A. leukocytes\nB. red blood cells\nC. pathogens\nD. glands","completion":"leukocytes\nExplanation: The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes make up about 25% of all leukocytes. The majority of lymphocytes are found in the lymphatic system, where they are most likely to encounter pathogens. The rest are found in the blood. There are two major types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. These cells get their names from the organs in which they mature. B cells mature in bone marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus. Both B and T cells recognize and respond to particular pathogens."}
{"prompt":"Question: Sutures, gomphoses, and syndesmoses are types of what, which are found where adjacent bones are strongly united by connective tissue?\nOptions:\n A. cartilage\nB. metallic joints\nC. fibrous joints\nD. ligaments","completion":"fibrous joints\nExplanation: 9.2 Fibrous Joints Fibrous joints are where adjacent bones are strongly united by fibrous connective tissue. The gap filled by connective tissue may be narrow or wide. The three types of fibrous joints are sutures, gomphoses, and syndesmoses. A suture is the narrow fibrous joint that unites most bones of the skull. At a gomphosis, the root of a tooth is anchored across a narrow gap by periodontal ligaments to the walls of its socket in the bony jaw. A syndesmosis is the type of fibrous joint found between parallel bones. The gap between the bones may be wide and filled with a fibrous interosseous membrane, or it may narrow with ligaments spanning between the bones. Syndesmoses are found between the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) and the leg (tibia and fibula). Fibrous joints strongly unite adjacent bones and thus serve to provide protection for internal organs, strength to body regions, or weight-bearing stability."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the force of attraction between two masses?\nOptions:\n A. electricity\nB. inertia\nC. momentum\nD. gravity","completion":"gravity\nExplanation: Gravity is traditionally defined as a force of attraction between two masses.

{"prompt":"Question: The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow and what else?\nOptions:\n A. thymus gland\nB. pinneal gland\nC. thyroid\nD. kidneys","completion":"thymus gland\nExplanation: Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune response. It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the body\u2019s own cells relatively intact. The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells of the body."}
{"prompt":"Question: Distance traveled divided by time is equal to what?\nOptions:\n A. direction\nB. momentum\nC. speed\nD. frequency","completion":"speed\nExplanation: Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance travelled by the time interval. For example, someone who takes 40 minutes to drive 20 miles north and then 20 miles south (to end up at the same place), has an average speed of 40 miles divided by 40 minutes, or 1 mile per minute (60 mph). Average velocity, however, involves total displacement, instead of distance. It is calculated by dividing the total displacement by the time interval. In this example, the driver's displacement is zero, which makes the average velocity zero mph."}
{"prompt":"Question: What forms when a solute dissolves in a solvent?\nOptions:\n A. chemical\nB. solution\nC. gas\nD. liquid","completion":"solution\nExplanation: A solution forms when a solute dissolves in a solvent. The rate of dissolving is faster with stirring, a higher temperature, or greater surface area. Many solutes are soluble in water because water is polar."}
{"prompt":"Question: The temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased is called what?\nOptions:\n A. 0 degrees kelvin\nB. stopping point\nC. absolute zero\nD. 0 degrees celcius","completion":"absolute zero\nExplanation: Making Connections: Absolute Zero What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. Figure 13.9 shows how the pressure of gases at a constant volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature, \u2013273.15\u00baC . This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called absolute zero. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is \u2013273.15\u00baC or 0 K."}
{"prompt":"Question: What form does water take on the planet mars?\nOptions:\n A. plasma\nB. gas\nC. ice\nD. liquid","completion":"ice\nExplanation: Water on Mars can't be a liquid. This is because the pressure of the atmosphere is too low. The planet does have a lot of water; it is in the form of ice. The south pole of Mars has a very visible ice cap. Scientists also have evidence that there is also a lot of ice just under the Martian surface. The ice melts when volcanoes erupt. At this times liquid water flows across the surface."}

{"prompt":"Question: What did roots evolve from that plants used for aborption?\nOptions:\n A. rhizoids\nB. seeds\nC. leguminous\nD. oomycetes","completion":"rhizoids\nExplanation: Roots are vascular organs that can penetrate soil and even rock. They absorb water and minerals from soil and carry them to leaves. They also anchor a plant in the soil. Roots evolved from rhizoids, which nonvascular plants had used for absorption."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the diffusion of water known as?\nOptions:\n A. evaporation\nB. osmosis\nC. electrolysis\nD. hemostasis","completion":"osmosis\nExplanation: Osmosis is the special case of the diffusion of water. It's an important means of transport in cells because the fluid inside and outside cells is mostly water. Water can pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion, but it can happen more quickly with the help of channel proteins. Water moves in or out of a cell by osmosis until its concentration is the same on both sides of the cell membrane."}
{"prompt":"Question: What might a scientist do to confirm the work of another?\nOptions:\n A. question their methods\nB. develop a completely different experiment\nC. replicate their work\nD. study their work","completion":"replicate their work\nExplanation: Scientists may work together on a project. One reason is that they can share equipment and personnel. Another reason is that they can share ideas. Scientists may also work separately. Even then, they use each other's data and interpretations. When one scientist publishes a paper, others will replicate the work to make sure they get the same result. If they do, the work is valid. If they don't, someone needs to find the source of the problem. Scientists openly communicate with each other on their results. They also discuss and sometimes disagree on their interpretations. If scientists do disagree, they will look for evidence so that they may resolve the disagreement."}

{"prompt":"Question: In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and?\nOptions:\n A. somatic mutations\nB. elective mutations\nC. comparative mutations\nD. resultant mutations","completion":"somatic mutations\nExplanation: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer."}

{"prompt":"Question: Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries and generally drain into what sinus?\nOptions:\n A. coronary\nB. Veins\nC. lungs\nD. heart","completion":"coronary\nExplanation: CHAPTER REVIEW 19.1 Heart Anatomy The heart resides within the pericardial sac and is located in the mediastinal space within the thoracic cavity. The pericardial sac consists of two fused layers: an outer fibrous capsule and an inner parietal pericardium lined with a serous membrane. Between the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial cavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The walls of the heart are composed of an outer epicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining layer of endocardium. The human heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels. The right atrium receives systemic blood relatively low in oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which pumps it into the pulmonary circuit. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and blood high in oxygen returns to the left atrium, which pumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps blood into the aorta and the remainder of the systemic circuit. The septa are the partitions that separate the chambers of the heart. They include the interatrial septum, the interventricular septum, and the atrioventricular septum. Two of these openings are guarded by the atrioventricular valves, the right tricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent the backflow of blood. Each is attached to chordae tendineae that extend to the papillary muscles, which are extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the valves from being blown back into the atria. The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is located at the base of the aorta. The right and left coronary arteries are the first to branch off the aorta and arise from two of the three sinuses located near the base of the aorta and are generally located in the sulci. Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries and generally drain into the coronary sinus."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does water infiltrate the ground?\nOptions:\n A. gravity\nB. prolonged drought conditions\nC. run-off from flooding\nD. because soil and rocks are porous","completion":"because soil and rocks are porous\nExplanation: Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock are porous. Between the grains are pores, or tiny holes. Since water can move through this rock it is permeable. Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is not porous and so is impermeable. Water stops moving downward when it reaches this layer of rock."}
{"prompt":"Question: Any sound with a frequency above the highest audible frequency is defined as what, a phenomenon useful in medical diagnosis and therapy?\nOptions:\n A. ultrasound\nB. laser\nC. radiation\nD. extrasound","completion":"ultrasound\nExplanation: Any sound with a frequency above 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz)\u2014that is, above the highest audible frequency\u2014is defined to be ultrasound. In practice, it is possible to create ultrasound frequencies up to more than a gigahertz. (Higher frequencies are difficult to create; furthermore, they propagate poorly because they are very strongly absorbed. ) Ultrasound has a tremendous number of applications, which range from burglar alarms to use in cleaning delicate objects to the guidance systems of bats. We begin our discussion of ultrasound with some of its applications in medicine, in which it is used extensively both for diagnosis and for therapy. Characteristics of Ultrasound The characteristics of ultrasound, such as frequency and intensity, are wave properties common to all types of waves. Ultrasound also has a wavelength that limits the fineness of detail it can detect. This characteristic is true of all waves. We can never observe details significantly smaller than the wavelength of our probe; for example, we will never see individual atoms with visible light, because the atoms are so small compared with the wavelength of light."}

Calcium is a soft, gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal. Although pure calcium doesn\u2019t exist in nature, calcium compounds are very common in Earth\u2019s crust and in sea water. Calcium is also the most abundant metal in the human body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. These calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains about a kilogram of calcium. Because calcium\u2014like barium\u2014absorbs x-rays, bones show up white in x-ray images. Calcium is an important component of a healthy human diet.

{"prompt":"Question: Interstitial carbides are produced by the reaction of most transition metals at high temperatures with what element?\nOptions:\n A. hydrogen\nB. oxygen\nC. carbon\nD. nitrogen","completion":"carbon\nExplanation: temperatures with electropositive metals such as those of groups 1 and 2 and aluminum produces ionic carbides, which contain discrete metal cations and carbon anions. The identity of the anions depends on the size of the second element. For example, smaller elements such as beryllium and aluminum give methides such as Be2C and Al4C3, which formally contain the C4\u2212 ion derived from methane (CH4) by losing all four H atoms as protons. In contrast, larger metals such as sodium and calcium give carbides with stoichiometries of Na2C2 and CaC2. Because these carbides contain the C4\u2212 ion, which is derived from acetylene (HC\u2261CH) by losing both H atoms as protons, they are more properly called acetylides. As discussed in Chapter 21 \"Periodic Trends and the \", Section 21.4 \"The Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2)\", reacting ionic carbides with dilute aqueous acid results in protonation of the anions to give the parent hydrocarbons: CH4 or C2H2. For many years, miners\u2019 lamps used the reaction of calcium carbide with water to produce a steady supply of acetylene, which was ignited to provide a portable lantern. The reaction of carbon with most transition metals at high temperatures produces interstitial carbides. Due to the less electropositive nature of the transition metals, these carbides contain covalent metal\u2013 carbon interactions, which result in different properties: most interstitial carbides are good conductors of electricity, have high melting points, and are among the hardest substances known. Interstitial carbides exhibit a variety of nominal compositions, and they are often nonstoichiometric compounds whose carbon content can vary over a wide range. Among the most important are tungsten carbide (WC), which is used industrially in high-speed cutting tools, and cementite (Fe3C), which is a major component of steel. Elements with an electronegativity similar to that of carbon form covalent carbides, such as silicon carbide (SiC; Equation 22.15) and boron carbide (B4C). These substances are extremely hard, have high melting points, and are chemically inert. For example, silicon carbide is highly resistant to chemical attack at temperatures as high as 1600\u00b0C. Because it also maintains its strength at high temperatures, silicon carbide is used in heating elements for electric furnaces and in variable-temperature resistors."}

{"prompt":"Question: The temperature of an object is a measure of what type of energy?\nOptions:\n A. thermal\nB. chemical\nC. magnetic\nD. density","completion":"thermal\nExplanation: Forms of Energy The forms of energy include thermal energy, radiant energy, electrical energy, nuclear energy, and chemical energy (Figure 5.1 \"Forms of Energy\"). Thermal energy results from atomic and molecular motion; the faster the motion, the greater the thermal energy. The temperature of an object is a measure of its thermal energy content. Radiant energy is the energy carried by light, microwaves, and radio waves. Objects left in bright sunshine or exposed to microwaves become warm because much of the radiant energy they absorb is converted to thermal energy. Electrical energy results from the flow of electrically charged particles. When the ground and a cloud develop a separation of charge, for example, the resulting flow of electrons from one to the other produces lightning, a natural form of electrical energy. Nuclear energy is stored in the nucleus of an atom, and chemical energy is stored within a chemical compound because of a particular arrangement of atoms. (a) Thermal energy results from atomic and molecular motion; molten steel at 2000\u00b0C has a very high thermal energy content. (b) Radiant energy (e. , from the sun) is the energy in light, microwaves, and radio waves. (c) Lightning is an example of electrical energy, which is due to the flow of electrically charged particles. (d)Nuclear."}
{"prompt":"Question: What two types of juices help digestion within the small intestine?\nOptions:\n A. chyme and phloem\nB. amniotic fluid, bile\nC. intestinal and pancreatic\nD. bile and lymph","completion":"intestinal and pancreatic\nExplanation: Chemical Digestion in the Small Intestine The digestion of proteins and carbohydrates, which partially occurs in the stomach, is completed in the small intestine with the aid of intestinal and pancreatic juices. Lipids arrive in the intestine largely undigested, so much of the focus here is on lipid digestion, which is facilitated by bile and the enzyme pancreatic lipase. Moreover, intestinal juice combines with pancreatic juice to provide a liquid medium that facilitates absorption. The intestine is also where most water is absorbed, via osmosis. The small intestine\u2019s absorptive cells also synthesize digestive enzymes and then place them in the plasma membranes of the microvilli. This distinguishes the small intestine from the stomach; that is, enzymatic digestion occurs not only in the lumen, but also on the luminal surfaces of the mucosal cells. For optimal chemical digestion, chyme must be delivered from the stomach slowly and in small amounts. This is because chyme from the stomach is typically hypertonic, and if large quantities were forced all at once into the small intestine, the resulting osmotic water loss from the blood into the intestinal lumen would result in potentially life-threatening low blood volume. In addition, continued digestion requires an upward adjustment of the low pH of stomach chyme, along with rigorous mixing of the chyme with bile and pancreatic juices. Both processes take time, so the pumping action of the pylorus must be carefully controlled to prevent the duodenum from being overwhelmed with chyme."}

The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of matter. Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter. That\u2019s because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat.

{"prompt":"Question: Some fish will be over-fished to the point that their species ceases to exist, which is also known as what?\nOptions:\n A. endangered\nB. accumulation\nC. extinction\nD. abundance","completion":"extinction\nExplanation: will inevitably make it more difficult and costly to grow food. The world\u2019s growing human population faces significant challenges in the increasing costs and other difficulties associated with producing food. Wild Food Sources In addition to growing crops and raising food animals, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily wild fish populations. For about one billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. But since 1990, production from global fisheries has declined. Despite considerable effort, few fisheries on Earth are managed sustainability. Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition to humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict. The collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local human populations that work in the fishery. In addition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in other ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species and the larger species are overfished. The ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources."}

{"prompt":"Question: What substance causes oxidation by accepting electrons?\nOptions:\n A. oxidizing agent\nB. solvents\nC. enzymes\nD. thermal agent","completion":"oxidizing agent\nExplanation: In the reaction above, the zinc is being oxidized by losing electrons. However, there must be another substance present that gains those electrons and in this case that is the sulfur. In other words, the sulfur is causing the zinc to be oxidized. Sulfur is called the oxidizing agent. The zinc causes the sulfur to gain electrons and become reduced and so the zinc is called the reducing agent. The oxidizing agent is a substance that causes oxidation by accepting electrons. The reducing agent is a substance that causes reduction by losing electrons. The simplest way to think of this is that the oxidizing agent is the substance that is reduced, while the reducing agent is the substance that is oxidized. The sample problem below shows how to analyze a redox reaction."}

{"prompt":"Question: Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to do this?\nOptions:\n A. multiply\nB. reproduce\nC. replicate\nD. feed","completion":"reproduce\nExplanation: The Chesapeake Bay (Figure 20.15a) is one of the most scenic areas on Earth; it is now in distress and is recognized as a case study of a declining ecosystem. In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first aquatic ecosystems to have identified dead zones, which continue to kill many fish and bottomdwelling species such as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have declined in the Chesapeake Bay because surface water runoff contains excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer use on land. The source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There are many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff from lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of industry, agriculture, and individual homeowners. Of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population (Figure 20.15b); it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. This decline was caused not only by fertilizer runoff and dead zones, but also because of overharvesting. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, thus greatly disrupting the ecosystem. The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but the oysters also clean up the bay. They are filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. Filter feeders eat by pumping a continuous stream of water over finely divided appendages (gills in the case of oysters) and capturing prokaryotes, plankton, and fine organic particles in their mucus. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with the changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job. Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the."}

This makes up the electromagnetic spectrum."}
{"prompt":"Question: How is blood supplied from the mother to the fetus?\nOptions:\n A. brain stem\nB. umbilical cord\nC. vagina\nD. spinal cord","completion":"umbilical cord\nExplanation: Hemoglobin of the Fetus The fetus has its own circulation with its own erythrocytes; however, it is dependent on the mother for oxygen. Blood is supplied to the fetus by way of the umbilical cord, which is connected to the placenta and separated from maternal blood by the chorion. The mechanism of gas exchange at the chorion is similar to gas exchange at the respiratory membrane. However, the partial pressure of oxygen is lower in the maternal blood in the placenta, at about 35 to 50 mm Hg, than it is in maternal arterial blood. The difference in partial pressures between maternal and fetal blood is not large, as the partial pressure of oxygen in fetal blood at the placenta is about 20 mm Hg. Therefore, there is not as much diffusion of oxygen into the fetal blood supply. The fetus\u2019 hemoglobin overcomes this problem by having a greater affinity for oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (Figure 22.27). Both fetal and adult hemoglobin have four subunits, but two of the subunits of fetal hemoglobin have a different structure that causes fetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin."}

Ammonia can be considered the simplest amine and has a very distinctive odor. Methylamine has an unpleasant odor associated with dead fish. Amines are often formed biologically during the breakdown of proteins in animal cells, and so many have the smell of death and decay. Putrescine and cadaverine are two such amines and are aptly named for their foul odors. The toxins which many animals use as a form of defense are frequently amines. Amines are used industrially as dyes and in many drugs."}

{"prompt":"Question: When something loses electrons, it must also?\nOptions:\n A. gain electrons\nB. reduce protons\nC. slow down\nD. gain protons","completion":"gain electrons\nExplanation: Solution The charges, as well as the atoms, must balance in reactions. The silver atom is being oxidized from the 0 oxidation state to the 1+ state. Whenever something loses electrons, something must also gain electrons (be reduced) to balance the equation. Oxygen is a good oxidizing agent for these reactions because it can gain electrons to go from the 0 oxidation state to the 2\u2212 state."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom called?\nOptions:\n A. non-valence electrons\nB. shell electrons\nC. gradient electrons\nD. valence electrons","completion":"valence electrons\nExplanation: In the study of chemical reactivity, we will find that the electrons in the outermost principal energy level are very important and so they are given a special name. Valence electrons are the electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom. In the second period elements listed above, the two electrons in the 1 s sublevel are called inner-shell electrons and are not involved directly in the element\u2019s reactivity or in the formation of compounds. Lithium has a single electron in the second principal energy level and so we say that lithium has one valence electron. Beryllium has two valence electrons. How many valence electrons does boron have? You must recognize that the second principal energy level consists of both the 2 s and the 2 p sublevels and so the answer is three. In fact, the number of valence electrons goes up by one for each step across a period until the last element is reached. Neon, with its configuration ending in s 2 p 6 , has eight valence electrons."}

{"prompt":"Question: What does pushing an object over the surface of a ramp cause?\nOptions:\n A. Acceleration\nB. friction\nC. vibration\nD. tension","completion":"friction\nExplanation: Consider the ramp in Figure below . It\u2019s easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground. However, pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction. Some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction. It would be more efficient to use a dolly on wheels to roll the furniture up the ramp. That\u2019s because rolling friction is much less than sliding friction. As a result, the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with a dolly."}

You might say that it\u2019s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler."}
{"prompt":"Question: Carbonic anhydrase plays what role to achieve a variety of results involving different organs?\nOptions:\n A. enzyme\nB. blocker\nC. sequence\nD. inhibition","completion":"enzyme\nExplanation: About 67 percent of the water, Na+, and K+ entering the nephron is reabsorbed in the PCT and returned to the circulation. Almost 100 percent of glucose, amino acids, and other organic substances such as vitamins are normally recovered here. Some glucose may appear in the urine if circulating glucose levels are high enough that all the glucose transporters in the PCT are saturated, so that their capacity to move glucose is exceeded (transport maximum, or Tm). In men, the maximum amount of glucose that can be recovered is about 375 mg\/min, whereas in women, it is about 300 mg\/min. This recovery rate translates to an arterial concentration of about 200 mg\/dL. Though an exceptionally high sugar intake might cause sugar to appear briefly in the urine, the appearance of glycosuria usually points to type I or II diabetes mellitus. The transport of glucose from the lumen of the PCT to the interstitial space is similar to the way it is absorbed by the small intestine. Both glucose and Na+ bind simultaneously to the same symport proteins on the apical surface of the cell to be transported in the same direction, toward the interstitial space. Sodium moves down its electrochemical and concentration gradient into the cell and takes glucose with it. Na+ is then actively pumped out of the cell at the basal surface of the cell into the interstitial space. Glucose leaves the cell to enter the interstitial space by facilitated diffusion. The energy to move glucose comes from the Na+\/K+ ATPase that pumps Na+ out of the cell on the basal surface. Fifty percent of Cl\u2013 and variable quantities of Ca++, Mg++, and HPO 24 \u2212 are also recovered in the PCT. Recovery of bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) is vital to the maintenance of acid\u2013base balance, since it is a very powerful and fast-acting buffer. An important enzyme is used to catalyze this mechanism: carbonic anhydrase (CA). This same enzyme and reaction is used in red blood cells in the transportation of CO2, in the stomach to produce hydrochloric acid, and in the pancreas to produce HCO3\u2013 to buffer acidic chyme from the stomach. In the kidney, most of the CA is located within the cell, but a small amount is bound to the brush border of the membrane on the apical surface of the cell. In the lumen of the PCT,."}
{"prompt":"Question: Pulmonary ventilation in mammals occurs via what?\nOptions:\n A. inhalation\nB. inflammation\nC. osmosis\nD. ingestion","completion":"inhalation\nExplanation: Mammalian Systems In mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing). During inhalation, air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose (Figure 39.7). As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified. The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air. Mucus is high in water. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system."}
{"prompt":"Question: When the oval window vibrates, it causes what else to vibrate as well?\nOptions:\n A. cilia\nB. the cochlea\nC. timpani\nD. hammer and anvil","completion":"the cochlea\nExplanation: The stirrup in the middle ear passes the amplified sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window. When the oval window vibrates, it causes the cochlea to vibrate as well. The cochlea is a shell-like structure that is full of fluid and lined with nerve cells called hair cells. Each hair cell has many tiny \u201chairs,\u201d as you can see in the magnified image below . When the cochlea vibrates, it causes waves in the fluid inside. The waves bend the \u201chairs\u201d on the hair cells, and this triggers electrical impulses. The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves. Only after the nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound."}
{"prompt":"Question: What features of a salamander's skin help protect itself from predators ?\nOptions:\n A. camouflaged and thin\nB. slimy and camouflaged\nC. thick and impenetrable\nD. brightly colored and poisonous","completion":"brightly colored and poisonous\nExplanation: Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten. Most salamanders have brightly colored, poisonous skin. The bold color tells predators not to eat the salamander. Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck or on the tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid. Some species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow a new one later. Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to scare away danger. One particular salamander, the ribbed newt, has needle-like rib tips. It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips pierce through its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom."}
{"prompt":"Question: A binary molecular compound is a molecular compound that is composed of what?\nOptions:\n A. two atoms\nB. four atoms\nC. four elements\nD. two elements","completion":"two elements\nExplanation: A binary molecular compound is a molecular compound that is composed of two elements. In general, the elements that combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetals. This contrasts with ionic compounds, which usually involve bonds between metal ions and nonmetal ions. Because ionic charges cannot be used to name these compounds or to write their formulas, a different naming system must be used for molecular compounds. Another difference between ionic and molecular compounds is that two nonmetal atoms will frequently combine with one another in a variety of ratios. For example, nitrogen and oxygen combine to make several binary compounds, including NO, NO 2 , and N 2 O. Obviously they can\u2019t all be called nitrogen oxide! How would someone know which one you were talking about? Each of the three compounds has very different properties and reactivity.

{"prompt":"Question: How are layers of the atmosphere divided?\nOptions:\n A. air gradients\nB. temperature gradients\nC. color gradients\nD. density gradients","completion":"temperature gradients\nExplanation: The layers of the atmosphere are divided by their temperature gradients. The lowest layer is the troposphere. All weather takes place in this layer. The next layer is the stratosphere. The stratosphere contains the protective ozone layer. More sunlight strikes at the Equator than at the poles. This is what drives the global winds. Warm air rises, moves poleward, and then sinks when it meets with air moving toward the Equator. The result is six atmospheric circulation cells around the world. There are three cells in each hemisphere. Pollutants enter the atmosphere from a few sources. The most important is fossil fuel burning. Air pollution has bad effects on the environment and on human health. By reducing fossil fuel use we can make the environment cleaner. When ozone depletion was found to be a problem, the world acted. As a result, the ozone hole has stabilized. The hole will be getting smaller over the next decades."}

{"prompt":"Question: Ribosomes are cellular substructures where what are synthesized?\nOptions:\n A. Molecule\nB. cells\nC. acids\nD. proteins","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Ribosomes are cellular substructures where proteins are synthesized. They contain about 65% rRNA and 35% protein, held together by numerous noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, in an overall structure consisting of two globular particles of unequal size. Molecules of tRNA, which bring amino acids (one at a time) to the ribosomes for the construction of proteins, differ from one another in the kinds of amino acid each is specifically designed to carry. A set of three nucleotides, known as a codon, on the mRNA determines which kind of tRNA will add its amino acid to the growing chain. (For more information on sequences, see Section 19.4 \"Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code\". ) Each of the 20 amino acids found in proteins has at least one corresponding kind of tRNA, and most amino acids have more than one. The two-dimensional structure of a tRNA molecule has three distinctive loops, reminiscent of a cloverleaf (Figure 19.11 \"Transfer RNA\"). On one loop is a sequence of three nucleotides that varies for each kind of tRNA. This triplet, called the anticodon, is complementary to and pairs with the codon on the mRNA. At the opposite end of the molecule is the acceptor stem, where the amino acid is attached. Figure 19.11 Transfer RNA Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where are sponges most likely anchored to?\nOptions:\n A. sea floor\nB. sand\nC. reef or rock\nD. beaches","completion":"reef or rock\nExplanation: Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish. Because sponges are anchored to a reef or rock, they can\u2019t run away from predators. However, their sharp spicules provide some defense. They also produce toxins that may poison predators that try to eat them."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do voltmeters measure?\nOptions:\n A. temperature\nB. voltage\nC. amplitude\nD. frequency","completion":"voltage\nExplanation: 21.4 DC Voltmeters and Ammeters \u2022 Voltmeters measure voltage, and ammeters measure current. \u2022 A voltmeter is placed in parallel with the voltage source to receive full voltage and must have a large resistance to limit its effect on the circuit. \u2022 An ammeter is placed in series to get the full current flowing through a branch and must have a small resistance to limit its effect on the circuit. \u2022 Both can be based on the combination of a resistor and a galvanometer, a device that gives an analog reading of current. \u2022 Standard voltmeters and ammeters alter the circuit being measured and are thus limited in accuracy."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the outermost occupied shell of electrons in an atom.\nOptions:\n A. valence shell\nB. Inner Shell\nC. radiative shell\nD. modular shell","completion":"valence shell\nExplanation: The valence shell is the outermost occupied shell of electrons in an atom. This shell holds the valence electrons, which are the electrons that are involved in bonding and shown in a Lewis structure. Valence-shell electron pair repulsion theory , or VSEPR theory, states that a molecule will adjust its shape so that the valence electron pairs stay as far apart from each other as possible. This makes sense, based on the fact that negatively charged electrons repel one another. We will systematically classify molecules according to the number of bonding pairs of electrons and the number of nonbonding or lone pairs around the central atom. For the purposes of the VSEPR model, a double or triple bond is no different in terms of repulsion than a single bond. We will begin by examining molecules in which the central atom does not have any lone pairs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What hypothetical link between development of herbivores and plant defenses is observed in nature, for instance in seeds that are unsavory to animals?\nOptions:\n A. coevolution\nB. interconnection\nC. abjection\nD. natural selection","completion":"coevolution\nExplanation: Animals and Plants: Herbivory Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic. Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory, or consumption of plants by insects and other animals. This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination. Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is observed in nature. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores. To \u201ccombat\u201d herbivores, some plant seeds\u2014such as acorn and unripened persimmon\u2014are high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory to some animals. Other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and chew vegetal material. Spines and thorns (Figure 26.18) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds have specialized beaks to get past such defenses."}

{"prompt":"Question: What determines the unique sequence for every protein?\nOptions:\n A. form encoding\nB. space encoding\nC. gene encoding\nD. variation encoding","completion":"gene encoding\nExplanation: The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of the gene\u2019s coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain (a small portion of which is shown in Figure 3.26) has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function. Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in the \u03b2 chain. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule\u2014which dramatically decreases life expectancy\u2014is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases."}

{"prompt":"Question: What conveys signals received by the eye to the brain?\nOptions:\n A. motor nerve\nB. sciatic nerve\nC. optic nerve\nD. sensory nerve","completion":"optic nerve\nExplanation: 26.1 Physics of the Eye The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. The eye is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color it can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction, to reach what is called \u201cnormal\u201d vision, but should be called ideal rather than normal. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze with the optics discussed in Geometric Optics. Figure 26.2 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the 10 lowest observable to 10 times greater (without damage). This is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain."}

{"prompt":"Question: In many cases, the alkali metal amide salt (mnh2) is not very soluble in liquid ammonia and does what?\nOptions:\n A. settles\nB. isolates\nC. precipitates\nD. evaporates","completion":"precipitates\nExplanation: where the (am) designation refers to an ammonia solution, analogous to (aq) used to indicate aqueous solutions. Without a catalyst, the reaction in Equation 21.20 tends to be rather slow. In many cases, the alkali metal amide salt (MNH2) is not very soluble in liquid ammonia and precipitates, but when dissolved, very concentrated solutions of the alkali metal are produced. One mole of Cs metal, for example, will dissolve in as little as 53 mL (40 g) of liquid ammonia. The pure metal is easily recovered when the ammonia evaporates. Solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are intensely colored and good conductors of electricity due to the presence of solvated electrons (e\u2212, NH3), which are not attached to single atoms. A solvated electron is loosely associated with a cavity in the ammonia solvent that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Alkali metal\u2013liquid ammonia solutions of about 3 M or less are deep blue (Figure 21.11 \"Alkali Metal\u2013Liquid Ammonia Solutions\") and conduct electricity about 10 times better than an aqueous NaCl solution because of the high mobility of the solvated electrons. As the concentration of the metal increases above 3 M, the color changes to metallic bronze or gold, and the conductivity increases to a value comparable with that of the pure liquid metals."}

{"prompt":"Question: Systemic veins return blood low in what to the right atrium?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. dioxide\nC. nutrients\nD. nitrogen","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Overview of Systemic Veins Systemic veins return blood to the right atrium. Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries, it will be relatively low in oxygen concentration. In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the body with the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another. This is often described as a \u201ccomplementary\u201d pattern. However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous circulation than normally occurs in the arteries. For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most commonly encountered patterns. However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice. In both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins. The deeper veins generally correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial counterparts, but in addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body temperature. When the ambient temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the environment. In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins and blood is diverted deeper where the body can retain more of the heat. The \u201cVoyage of Discovery\u201d analogy and stick drawings mentioned earlier remain valid techniques for the study of systemic veins, but veins present a more difficult challenge because there are numerous anastomoses and multiple branches. It is like following a river with many tributaries and channels, several of which interconnect. Tracing blood flow through arteries follows the current in the direction of blood flow, so that we move from the heart through the large arteries and into the smaller arteries to the capillaries. From the capillaries, we move into the smallest veins and follow the direction of blood flow into larger veins and back to the heart. Figure 20.35 outlines the path of the major systemic veins."}
{"prompt":"Question: The ph scale is a scale used to express the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution. a neutral solution, neither acidic nor basic, has a ph of what?\nOptions:\n A. 6\nB. 0\nC. 7\nD. 8","completion":"7\nExplanation: dissociated ions. It is a dynamic equilibrium because acid and base molecules are constantly dissociating into ions and reassociating into neutral molecules. The pH scale is a scale used to express the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution. A neutral solution, neither acidic nor basic, has a pH of 7. Acidic solutions have a pH lower than 7, while basic solutions have a pH higher than 7. Buffers are solutions that resist dramatic changes in pH when an acid or a base is added to them. They contain a weak acid and a salt of that weak acid, or a weak base and a salt of that weak base. When a buffer is present, any strong acid reacts with the anion of the salt, forming a weak acid and minimizing the presence of hydrogen ions in solution. Any strong base reacts with the weak acid, minimizing the amount of additional hydroxide ions in solution. However, buffers only have limited capacity; there is a limit to the amount of strong acid or strong base any given amount of buffer will react with."}

{"prompt":"Question: A sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become what?\nOptions:\n A. embryo\nB. fertilized egg\nC. fetus\nD. unfertilized egg","completion":"fertilized egg\nExplanation: The Neural Tube To begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts dividing to generate the cells that make up an entire organism. Sixteen days after fertilization, the developing embryo\u2019s cells belong to one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body. The endoderm, or inner tissue, is responsible for generating the lining tissues of various spaces within the body, such as the mucosae of the digestive and respiratory systems. The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most of the muscle and connective tissues. Finally the ectoderm, or outer tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the nervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body. But how is it responsible for the nervous system? As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium, forming a neural plate. The cells then begin to change shape, causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward (Figure 13.2). A neural groove forms, visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo. The ridge-like edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold. As the neural folds come together and converge, the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube. Cells from the neural folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as the neural crest, which runs lateral to the neural tube. The neural crest migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form along the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue. Many tissues that are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural crest, such as craniofacial cartilage and bone, and melanocytes."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population called?\nOptions:\n A. allele commonness\nB. trait frequency\nC. allele frequecy\nD. allele rarity","completion":"allele frequecy\nExplanation: The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of [1] copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population. The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can alter the population\u2019s genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population. Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect. Natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which type of tree loses its leaves each fall and remains leafless in the winter?\nOptions:\n A. deciduous\nB. perennial\nC. conifer\nD. annual","completion":"deciduous\nExplanation: Temperate Forests Temperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Chile, and New Zealand (Figure 20.18). This biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions. Temperatures range between \u201330oC and 30oC (\u201322oF to 86oF) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. These temperatures mean that temperate forests have defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5\u201359 in). Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome with fewer evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, little photosynthesis occurs during the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as temperature increases. Because of the dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical rainforests. In addition, temperate forests show far less diversity of tree species than tropical rainforest biomes. The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, more sunlight reaches the ground in this biome than in tropical rainforests because trees in temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical rainforests. The soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients compared to tropical rainforests. This is because of the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors and reduced leaching of nutrients by rainfall. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates and their predators (Figure 20.24)."}

The angle of the ribs forms the most posterior portion of the thoracic cage. The costal groove in the inferior margin of each rib carries blood vessels and a nerve. Anteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs (1\u20137) attach directly to the sternum via their costal cartilage. The false ribs (8\u201312) either attach to the sternum indirectly or not at all. Ribs 8\u201310 have their costal cartilages attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib. The floating ribs (11\u201312) are short and do not attach to the sternum or to another rib."}
{"prompt":"Question: What a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid?\nOptions:\n A. crystal regia\nB. acidus regia\nC. sulfate regia\nD. aqua regia","completion":"aqua regia\nExplanation: Aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, is one of the few materials that will dissolve gold. This material, translated to \"royal water\" in English, was named so because it could dissolve the royal metal gold. First noted in the fourteenth century, aqua regia could be used to help ascertain whether a particular material was actually gold or was some trickery of the alchemist. Nitric acid by itself will not dissolve gold, but will in combination with hydrochloric acid. The chemistry of the process is rather complex, with both acids reacting with the metal to form soluble gold compounds. The gold can be recovered from the solution, making the process useful for purification purposes."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the use of radioactive decay to estimate the ages of fossils and rock?\nOptions:\n A. isotope test\nB. microwave theory\nC. radioactive dating\nD. radioactive illustrating","completion":"radioactive dating\nExplanation: Radioactive dating is the use of radioactive decay to estimate the ages of fossils and rocks.

{"prompt":"Question: What gas is expired out of the body during exhalation?\nOptions:\n A. carbon monoxide\nB. hydrogen\nC. oxygen\nD. carbon dioxide","completion":"carbon dioxide\nExplanation: Introduction Breathing is an involuntary event. How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain. Humans, when they aren\u2019t exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. Canines, like the dog in Figure 39.1, have a respiratory rate of about 15\u201330 breaths per minute. With every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out. That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. Oxygen (O2) enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce ATP, a high-energy compound. At the same time, these reactions release carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-product. CO2 is toxic and must be eliminated. Carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the stalk connecting a leaf to a stem?\nOptions:\n A. cuticle\nB. blades\nC. base\nD. petiole","completion":"petiole\nExplanation: Figure 30.4 Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes. An internode is the stem region between two nodes. The petiole is the stalk connecting the leaf to the stem. The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary buds."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is located beneath the lithosphere?\nOptions:\n A. hydropshere\nB. troposphere\nC. asthenosphere\nD. magnetosphere","completion":"asthenosphere\nExplanation: Beneath the lithosphere, the asthenosphere is solid rock that can flow."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does the second number in a blood pressure reading measure?\nOptions:\n A. external pressure\nB. optimal pressure\nC. diastolic pressure\nD. epithelial pressure","completion":"diastolic pressure\nExplanation: Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The first number is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries. The diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting between beats."}
{"prompt":"Question: Electrons always result in what?\nOptions:\n A. A HYPER-PIGMENTATION THAT IS LARGER THAN THE PARENT ATOM\nB. an anion that is larger than the parent atom\nC. an contraposition that is larger than the parent atom\nD. an dissociative that is larger than the parent atom","completion":"an anion that is larger than the parent atom\nExplanation: The addition of electrons always results in an anion that is larger than the parent atom. When the electrons outnumber the protons, the overall attractive force that the protons have for the electrons is decreased. The electron cloud also spreads out because more electrons results in greater electron-electron repulsions. Notice that the group 16 ions are larger than the group 17 ions. The group 16 elements each add two electrons while the group 17 elements add one electron per atom for form the anions."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term means opposition to the flow of electric charges that occurs when electric current travels through matter?\nOptions:\n A. polarity\nB. antagonism\nC. resistance\nD. diffusion","completion":"resistance\nExplanation: Resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges that occurs when electric current travels through matter. The SI unit of resistance is the ohm (named for the scientist Georg Ohm, whom you can read about below). Resistance is caused by electrons in a current bumping into electrons and ions in the matter through which the current is flowing. Resistance is similar to the friction that resists the movement of one surface as it slides over another. Resistance reduces the amount of current that can travel through the material because some of the electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb, the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge, and some of the electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides?\nOptions:\n A. fission\nB. Osmosis\nC. cytokinesis\nD. mitosis","completion":"mitosis\nExplanation: Mitosis in the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle. Mitosis is the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides."}
{"prompt":"Question: What normally prevent a positively charged particle from colliding and reacting with a positively charged nucleus, but may be overcome by kinetic energy?.\nOptions:\n A. electrostatic repulsions\nB. kinetic repulsions\nC. toxic repulsion\nD. evaporation repulsions","completion":"electrostatic repulsions\nExplanation: Bombarding a target of one element with high-energy nuclei or subatomic particles can create new elements. Electrostatic repulsions normally prevent a positively charged particle from colliding and reacting with a positively charged nucleus. If the positively charged particle is moving at a very high speed, however, its kinetic energy may be great enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsions, and it may collide with the target nucleus. Such collisions can result in a nuclear transmutation reaction."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does the slope of a position-time graph represent?\nOptions:\n A. trajectory\nB. direction\nC. acceleration\nD. velocity","completion":"velocity\nExplanation: The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity.

{"prompt":"Question: What can occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in liquid?\nOptions:\n A. capillary action\nB. diffusion action\nC. transfusion action\nD. thermal action","completion":"capillary action\nExplanation: Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made of molecules that are attracted to water molecules. Most cloth towels are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp. Both consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many \u2212OH groups. Water molecules are attracted to these \u2212OH groups and form hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose molecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers. Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in a liquid, as illustrated in Figure 10.20. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the higher the liquid climbs. It is partly by capillary action occurring in plant cells called xylem that water and dissolved nutrients are brought from the soil up through the roots and into a plant. Capillary action is the basis for thin layer chromatography, a laboratory technique commonly used to separate small quantities of mixtures. You depend on a constant supply of tears to keep your eyes lubricated and on capillary action to pump tear fluid away."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of blood?\nOptions:\n A. garble\nB. music\nC. murmur\nD. whisper","completion":"murmur\nExplanation: The term murmur is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of blood. Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the least serious. The most severe is a 6. Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to record both normal and abnormal sounds using specialized electronic stethoscopes. During auscultation, it is common practice for the clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply. This procedure not only allows for listening to airflow, but it may also amplify heart murmurs. Inhalation increases blood flow into the right side of the heart and may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs. Expiration partially restricts blood flow into the left side of the heart and may amplify left-sided heart murmurs. Figure 19.30 indicates proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope to facilitate auscultation."}
{"prompt":"Question: Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma are all components of what fluid?\nOptions:\n A. heart\nB. brain\nC. blood\nD. Vessals","completion":"blood\nExplanation: 40.2 Components of the Blood Specific components of the blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and the plasma, which contains coagulation factors and serum. Blood is important for regulation of the body\u2019s pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, the circulation of nutrients and removal of waste, the distribution of hormones from endocrine glands, and the elimination of excess heat; it also contains components for blood clotting. Red blood cells are specialized cells that contain hemoglobin and circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells. White blood cells are involved in the immune response to identify and target invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms; they also recycle waste components, such as old red blood cells. Platelets and blood clotting factors cause the change of the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a wound site forming a plug. Plasma consists of 90 percent water along with various substances, such as coagulation factors and antibodies. The serum is the plasma component of the blood without the coagulation factors."}
{"prompt":"Question: What natural resource can be damaged by the accumulation of too much salt?\nOptions:\n A. soil\nB. forests\nC. sediment\nD. mineral","completion":"soil\nExplanation: Soils may also remain in place but become degraded.

{"prompt":"Question: What plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion.\nOptions:\n A. efficiency\nB. frame\nC. fulcrum\nD. torque","completion":"torque\nExplanation: of pivot point, and so we choose the pivot point to simplify the solution of the problem. Second, the acceleration due to gravity canceled in this problem, and we were left with a ratio of masses. This will not always be the case. Always enter the correct forces\u2014do not jump ahead to enter some ratio of masses. Third, the weight of each child is distributed over an area of the seesaw, yet we treated the weights as if each force were exerted at a single point. This is not an approximation\u2014the distances r 1 and r 2 are the distances to points directly below the center of gravity of each child. As we shall see in the next section, the mass and weight of a system can act as if they are located at a single point. Finally, note that the concept of torque has an importance beyond static equilibrium. Torque plays the same role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion. We will examine this in the next chapter. Take-Home Experiment Take a piece of modeling clay and put it on a table, then mash a cylinder down into it so that a ruler can balance on the round side of the cylinder while everything remains still. Put a penny 8 cm away from the pivot. Where would you need to put two pennies to balance? Three pennies?."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts, including vitamins and minerals?\nOptions:\n A. minor nutrients\nB. insignificant nutrients\nC. trace nutrients\nD. micronutrients","completion":"micronutrients\nExplanation: Nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts are called micronutrients . They include vitamins and minerals. Vitamins are organic compounds that are needed by the body to function properly. Several vitamins are described in Table below . Vitamins play many roles in good health, ranging from maintaining good vision to helping blood clot. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Vitamin D is synthesized by the skin when it is exposed to UV light. Most other vitamins must be obtained from foods like those listed in Table below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which is the active ingredient of cereal crop disease, ergot?\nOptions:\n A. byblis acid\nB. amino acid\nC. pixelation acid\nD. lysergic acid","completion":"lysergic acid\nExplanation: Plant Parasites and Pathogens The production of sufficient good-quality crops is essential to human existence. Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (Figure 24.25). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of disease is muscular dystrophy?\nOptions:\n A. a wasting disease\nB. contagious disease\nC. mutation\nD. infectious disease","completion":"a wasting disease\nExplanation: Muscular dystrophy is a term encompassing a variety of muscle wasting diseases. The most common type, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) , affects cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as some mental functions. DMD is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin, a protein prevalent in skeletal and cardiac muscles. DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder occurring in 1 in 3,500 male newborns. Because DMD is X-linked, no females are affected. Most affected individuals die before their 20th birthday. Daughters of female carriers of the mutant allele have a 50% chance of also being carriers."}
{"prompt":"Question: What element is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels?\nOptions:\n A. carbon\nB. helium\nC. oxygen\nD. sulfur","completion":"sulfur\nExplanation: water. Sulfur, critical to the 3\u2013D folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal. The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, mineral nutrients are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between the biotic and abiotic world."}

{"prompt":"Question: The lunar landscape is covered by craters caused by what?\nOptions:\n A. earth impacts\nB. volcanoes\nC. water\nD. asteroid impacts","completion":"asteroid impacts\nExplanation: The landscape of the Moon - its surface features - is very different from Earth. The lunar landscape is covered by craters caused by asteroid impacts ( Figure below ). The craters are bowl-shaped basins on the Moon\u2019s surface. Because the Moon has no water, wind, or weather, the craters remain unchanged."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe a cross between two individuals that have different traits?\nOptions:\n A. assimilation\nB. hybridization\nC. fraternization\nD. purebreed","completion":"hybridization\nExplanation: Mendel first worked with plants that differed in a single characteristic, such as flower color. A hybridization is a cross between two individuals that have different traits. A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined is called a monohybrid cross . The offspring of such a cross are called monohybrids. Mendel noted that hybridizing true-breeding (P generation) plants gave rise to an F 1 generation that showed only one trait of a characteristic. For example, a true-breeding purple-flowering plant crossed with a true-breeding white-flowering plant always gave rise to purple-flowered hybrid plants. There were no white-flowered hybrids. Mendel wanted to know what happened to the white-flowers. If indeed a \"heritable factor\" for white-flower had disappeared, all future offspring of the hybrids would be purple-flowered - none would be white. To test this idea, Mendel let the F 1 generation plants self-pollinate and then planted the resulting seeds."}

This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. Fission of a tiny pellet of radioactive uranium-235, like the one pictured in the Figure below , releases as much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal!."}
{"prompt":"Question: When energy is captured or transformed, it inevitably degrades and becomes what less useful form of energy?\nOptions:\n A. chemical\nB. temperature\nC. motion\nD. heat","completion":"heat\nExplanation: Physics also tells us that, although energy can be captured or transformed, it inevitably degrades, becoming heat, a less useful form of energy. This is why organisms require a constant input of energy; the work they must do uses up the energy they take in. Energy, unlike materials, cannot be recycled. The story of life is a story of energy flow \u2013 its capture, transformation, use for work, and loss as heat."}
{"prompt":"Question: Most motions in nature follow ________ rather than straight lines?\nOptions:\n A. vertical paths\nB. sharp paths\nC. horizontal paths\nD. curved paths","completion":"curved paths\nExplanation: Introduction to Two-Dimensional Kinematics The arc of a basketball, the orbit of a satellite, a bicycle rounding a curve, a swimmer diving into a pool, blood gushing out of a wound, and a puppy chasing its tail are but a few examples of motions along curved paths. In fact, most motions in nature follow curved paths rather than straight lines. Motion along a curved path on a flat surface or a plane (such as that of a ball on a pool table or a skater on an ice rink) is two-dimensional, and thus described by two-dimensional kinematics. Motion not confined to a plane, such as a car following a winding mountain road, is described by three-dimensional kinematics. Both two- and threedimensional kinematics are simple extensions of the one-dimensional kinematics developed for straight-line motion in the previous chapter. This simple extension will allow us to apply physics to many more situations, and it will also yield unexpected insights about nature."}

Until the soccer player kicks the ball in Figure below , the ball remains motionless on the ground. However, when the ball is kicked, the force on it is suddenly unbalanced. The ball starts moving across the field because its inertia has been overcome."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is used by sensitive systems to detect even low levels of radiation?\nOptions:\n A. electrons\nB. radars\nC. crystals\nD. ions","completion":"crystals\nExplanation: Measurement of exposure to radioactivity is important for anyone who deals with radioactive materials on a regular basis. Perhaps the simplest device is a personal dosimeter \u2013 a film badge that will fog up when exposed to radiation. The amount of fogging is proportional to the amount of radiation present. These devices are not very sensitive to low levels of radiation. More sensitive systems use crystals that respond in some way to radioactivity by registering the number of emissions in a given time. These systems tend to be more sensitive and more reliable than film badges."}

{"prompt":"Question: All matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms. all atoms of an element are identical in mass and this?\nOptions:\n A. acid properties\nB. liquid properties\nC. chemical properties\nD. electrical properties","completion":"chemical properties\nExplanation: All matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms. All atoms of an element are identical in mass and chemical properties, whereas atoms of different elements differ in mass and fundamental chemical properties. A chemical compound is a substance that always contains the same atoms in the same ratio. In chemical reactions, atoms from one or more compounds or elements redistribute or rearrange in relation to other atoms to form one or more new compounds. Atoms themselves do not undergo a change of identity in chemical reactions. This last hypothesis suggested that the alchemists\u2019 goal of transmuting other elements to gold was impossible, at least through chemical reactions.

In a covalent compound, atoms of the different elements are held together in molecules by covalent bonds. These are chemical bonds in which atoms share valence electrons. The force of attraction between the shared electrons and the positive nuclei of both atoms holds the atoms together in the molecule. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound."}
{"prompt":"Question: The goal of proteomics is to identify or compare what substances expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between them, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. cells\nC. dna\nD. rna","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous solution. Protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins. Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.17) have provided the basis for protein microarrays. Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis. Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology. Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data. Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins. Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action."}

The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of cell division produces gametes?\nOptions:\n A. mutations\nB. apoptosis\nC. mitosis\nD. meiosis","completion":"meiosis\nExplanation: Sexual reproduction involves two parents. As you can see from Figure below , in sexual reproduction, parents produce reproductive cells\u2014called gametes \u2014that unite to form an offspring. Gametes are haploid cells. This means they contain only half the number of chromosomes found in other cells of the organism. Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis, which is described in detail below. The process in which two gametes unite is called fertilization . The fertilized cell that results is referred to as a zygote . A zygote is diploid cell, which means that it has twice the number of chromosomes as a gamete."}

This is called alternation of generations , because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry?\nOptions:\n A. synthesise , or hyperopia\nB. farsightedness, or hyperopia\nC. nearsightedness or hyperopia\nD. gleam , or hyperopia","completion":"farsightedness, or hyperopia\nExplanation: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it."}
{"prompt":"Question: How do some animals change their depth?\nOptions:\n A. by changing their density\nB. mass migration\nC. metamorphosis\nD. spontaneous mutations","completion":"by changing their density\nExplanation: Some animals change their depth by changing their density. Recall that things that are denser than their surroundings sink while those that are less dense than their surroundings float. Most fish have a swim bladder, a special sac that is filled with gases from their blood. When the fish's swim bladder is full, it is less dense than the surrounding water and the fish will rise towards the surface. Another property of water that affects lakes is the unique changes in density during phase changes. The density of most substances increases when a liquid becomes a solid. This is not so for water: Solid water is actually less dense than liquid water. It is for this reason that ice floats. Can you imagine a world where ice sank? Lakes would freeze from the bottom up, killing many fish. Frozen water in the Polar Regions would sink and change the ocean levels. The fact that ice floats is essential for the survival of many aquatic ecosystems and ultimately life on Earth. Besides the changes in density, there are other ways in which the phase changes of water have significant impacts. When water is trapped in small cracks in rocks, it will expand as it freezes and break up the rock causing weathering. The transpiration (evaporation) of water from a good-sized tree can move 1800 liters of water out of the ground in a single day. Sublimation, the phase change between solid and gas, is responsible for the formation of frost. As you can see, water has many special properties that make its role in nature unique. It is considered the \"universal solvent\u201d because its bipolar molecule enables it to dissolve a wide variety of substances. Water is the only substance that occurs naturally in all three states; solid, liquid, and gas. Water is truly a miracle for life!."}
{"prompt":"Question: In order to survive and maintain what state, an organism must quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions?\nOptions:\n A. ketosis\nB. acclimatization\nC. regulation\nD. homeostasis","completion":"homeostasis\nExplanation: In prokaryotes, a combination of activators and repressors determines whether a gene is transcribed. As you know, prokaryotic organisms are fairly simple organisms with much less DNA. Prokaryotic genes are arranged in operons , a region of DNA with a promoter, an operator , and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task. To maintain homeostasis (and survive), the organism must quickly adapt changing environmental conditions. The regulation of transcription plays a key role in this process."}

Other times the data disproves the hypothesis. Sometimes it's not possible to tell. If there is no conclusion, the scientist may test the hypothesis again. This time he will use some different experiments. No matter what the experiment shows the scientist has learned something. Even a disproved hypothesis can lead to new questions."}
{"prompt":"Question: Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, which means each organism is assigned what?\nOptions:\n A. complex name\nB. simple name\nC. single name\nD. two-part name","completion":"two-part name\nExplanation: Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature , a way to give a scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyote's species name is Canis latrans . Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra , and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum , are both in the same genus and they look similar ( Figure below ). Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin."}

{"prompt":"Question: Momentum is directly related to both mass and?\nOptions:\n A. mass\nB. intensity\nC. velocity\nD. speed","completion":"velocity\nExplanation: This equation shows that momentum is directly related to both mass and velocity. An object has greater momentum if it has greater mass, greater velocity, or both. For example, a bowling ball has greater momentum than a softball when both are moving at the same velocity because the bowling ball has greater mass. However, a softball moving at a very high velocity \u2014 say, 100 miles an hour \u2014 would have greater momentum than a slow-rolling bowling ball. If an object isn\u2019t moving at all, it has no momentum. That\u2019s because its velocity is zero, and zero times anything is zero."}

{"prompt":"Question: The urea cycle, a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions to prevent toxicity, occurs to some extent in the kidney, but primarily in what organ?\nOptions:\n A. liver\nB. spleen\nC. skin\nD. colon","completion":"liver\nExplanation: Urea Cycle The urea cycle is a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions in order to prevent a toxic level of ammonium in the body. It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle, ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion, from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This transamination event creates a molecule that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated. In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO2, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the kidneys in the urine (Figure 24.18)."}

{"prompt":"Question: The word fungus comes from the latin word for what?\nOptions:\n A. mold\nB. mushroom\nC. vegetable\nD. spore","completion":"mushroom\nExplanation: Introduction The word fungus comes from the Latin word for mushrooms. Indeed, the familiar mushroom is a reproductive structure used by many types of fungi. However, there are also many fungi species that don't produce mushrooms at all. Being eukaryotes, a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles. The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as Eucomycota, or true Fungi. While scientists have identified about 100,000 species of fungi, this is only a fraction of the 1.5 million species of fungus likely present on Earth. Edible mushrooms, yeasts, black mold, and the producer of the antibiotic penicillin, Penicillium notatum, are all members of the kingdom Fungi, which belongs to the domain Eukarya. Fungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants. Fungi are not capable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon. Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations. Most fungi produce a large number of spores, which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals. Like bacteria, fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules. Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae. Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively, lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga). Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native species of elm (Ulmus sp. ) by infecting the tree\u2019s vascular system. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector, transmitting the disease from tree to tree."}

{"prompt":"Question: Gases can be classifed as real or what?\nOptions:\n A. noble\nB. ideal\nC. shape\nD. dense","completion":"ideal\nExplanation: Did you notice that none of these statements relates to the identity of the gas? This means that all gases should behave similarly. A gas that follows these statements perfectly is called an ideal gas. Most gases show slight deviations from these statements and are called real gases. However, the existence of real gases does not diminish the importance of the kinetic theory of gases. One of the statements of the kinetic theory mentions collisions. As gas particles are constantly moving, they are also constantly colliding with each other and with the walls of their container. There are forces involved as gas particles bounce off the container walls (Figure 8.9 \"Gas Pressure\"). The force generated by gas particles divided by the."}

{"prompt":"Question: The addition of electron gives the halide ions the same electron configuration as what gas?\nOptions:\n A. a flammable gas\nB. a fatty gas\nC. a noble gas\nD. an inert gas","completion":"a noble gas\nExplanation: The elements of the halogen group (Group 17) gain electrons most readily, as can be seen from their large negative electron affinities. This means that more energy is released in the formation of a halide ion than for the anions of any other elements. Considering electron configuration, it is easy to see why. The outer configuration of all halogens is n s 2 n p 5 . The addition of one more electron gives the halide ions the same electron configuration as a noble gas, which we have seen is particularly stable."}
{"prompt":"Question: The majority of salamanders lack what organs, so respiration occurs through the skin or through external gills?\nOptions:\n A. throats\nB. lungs\nC. mouths\nD. noses","completion":"lungs\nExplanation: Modern Amphibians Amphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world. Amphibians can be divided into three clades: Urodela (\u201ctailed-ones\u201d), the salamanders; Anura (\u201ctail-less ones\u201d), the frogs; and Apoda (\u201clegless ones\u201d), the caecilians. Urodela: Salamanders Salamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela. Living salamanders (Figure 29.16) include approximately 620 species, some of which are aquatic, other terrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults. Adult salamanders usually have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail. They move by bending their bodies from side to side, called lateral undulation, in a fish-like manner while \u201cwalking\u201d their arms and legs fore and aft. It is thought that their gait is similar to that used by early tetrapods. Respiration differs among different species. The majority of salamanders are lungless, and respiration occurs through the skin or through external gills. Some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs; a few species have both gills and lungs. Unlike frogs, virtually all salamanders rely on internal fertilization of the eggs. The only male amphibians that possess copulatory structures are the caecilians, so fertilization among salamanders typically involves an elaborate and often prolonged courtship. Such a courtship allows the successful transfer of sperm from male to female via a spermatophore. Development in many of the most highly evolved salamanders, which are fully terrestrial, occurs during a prolonged egg stage, with the eggs guarded by the mother. During this time, the gilled larval stage is found only within the egg capsule, with the gills being resorbed, and metamorphosis being completed, before hatching. Hatchlings thus resemble tiny adults."}

{"prompt":"Question: What describes the amount of solute in a solution?\nOptions:\n A. viscosity\nB. solubility\nC. frequency\nD. tonicity","completion":"tonicity\nExplanation: Tonicity Tonicity describes the amount of solute in a solution. The measure of the tonicity of a solution, or the total amount of solutes dissolved in a specific amount of solution, is called its osmolarity. Three terms\u2014hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic\u2014are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a hypotonic solution, such as tap water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm. ) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell. This may cause an animal cell to burst, or lyse. In a hypertonic solution (the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher concentration of solutes than the cell\u2019s cytoplasm), the fluid contains less water than the cell does, such as seawater. Because the cell has a lower."}

{"prompt":"Question: Bacteria may become untreatable if they develop what in response to multiple antibiotics?\nOptions:\n A. affinity\nB. weakness\nC. acceptance\nD. resistance","completion":"resistance\nExplanation: Evasion of the Immune System by Pathogens It is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens, pathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response. An example already mentioned is in Mycobactrium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the macrophages that ingest them, and thus persists in the host, causing the chronic disease tuberculosis. This section briefly summarizes other ways in which pathogens can \u201coutwit\u201d immune responses. But keep in mind, although it seems as if pathogens have a will of their own, they do not. All of these evasive \u201cstrategies\u201d arose strictly by evolution, driven by selection. Bacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of Staphylococcus aureus. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy people harbor it in their nose. One small group of strains of this bacterium, however, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable. Different bacterial strains differ in the antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species survives. Another method of immune evasion is mutation. Because viruses\u2019 surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses like influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to the next. New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season. Genetic recombination\u2014the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens\u2014is an efficient form of immune evasion. For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different viruses infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different types. Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been shown to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV."}

{"prompt":"Question: Removal of dams on rivers is an example of what?\nOptions:\n A. evolution\nB. restoration\nC. reproduction\nD. renewal","completion":"restoration\nExplanation: 21.3 Preserving Biodiversity Five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record. Recent extinctions are recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary extinction rates. The other method uses measures of habitat loss and species-area relationships. Estimates of contemporary extinction rates vary but are as high as 500 times the background rate, as determined from the fossil record, and are predicted to rise. There is a legislative framework for biodiversity protection. International treaties such as CITES regulate the transportation of endangered species across international borders. Legislation within individual countries protecting species and agreements on global warming have had limited success; there is at present no international agreement on targets for greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act protects listed species but is hampered by procedural difficulties and a focus on individual species. The Migratory Bird Act is an agreement between Canada and the United States to protect migratory birds. The non-profit sector is also very active in conservation efforts in a variety of ways. Conservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity protection. Presently, 11 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface is protected in some way. The science of island biogeography has informed the optimal design of preserves; however, preserves have limitations imposed by political and economic forces. In addition, climate change will limit the effectiveness of present preserves in the future. A downside of preserves is that they may lessen the pressure on human societies to function more sustainably outside the preserves. Habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels before species become extinct. Examples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone species and removal of dams on rivers. Zoos have attempted to take a more active role in conservation and can have a limited role in captive breeding programs. Zoos also have a useful role in education."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term describes a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait?\nOptions:\n A. genetic marker\nB. nucleic acid chain\nC. analogous effect\nD. autosomal","completion":"genetic marker\nExplanation: 17.2 | Mapping Genomes By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Define genomics \u2022 Describe genetic and physical maps \u2022 Describe genomic mapping methods Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change."}

{"prompt":"Question: Hypersensitivity may refer to a maladaptive response of what system toward a harmless foreign substance?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. brain\nC. immune\nD. System","completion":"immune\nExplanation: Hypersensitivities Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large proportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity. Allergies The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. Figure 42.26 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild."}
{"prompt":"Question: Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the ________ to __________ electrode.\nOptions:\n A. neutral; negative\nB. negative; positive\nC. negative; neutral\nD. positive; negative","completion":"negative; positive\nExplanation: Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way.

{"prompt":"Question: In eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different what?\nOptions:\n A. organisms\nB. organelles\nC. atoms\nD. electrons","completion":"organelles\nExplanation: Enzyme Compartmentalization In eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet another level of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes can be housed separately along with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take place exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials, located within lysosomes. Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. A major question remains, however: What are these molecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you\u2019ve learned. What other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition? The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. Some of these molecules include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production (Figure 6.21). The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms described above."}

When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out."}
{"prompt":"Question: In what organ does pepsin help break down proteins?\nOptions:\n A. kidney\nB. stomach\nC. liver\nD. skin","completion":"stomach\nExplanation: Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can do their job only at a certain level of acidity. Cells secrete acids and bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work. For example, every time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive system. Consider the enzyme pepsin, which helps break down proteins in the stomach. Pepsin needs an acidic environment to do its job, and the stomach secretes a strong acid that allows pepsin to work. However, when stomach contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized. This is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in order to work. An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the first part of the large intestine called?\nOptions:\n A. cecum\nB. duodenum\nC. colon\nD. jejunum","completion":"cecum\nExplanation: Cecum The first part of the large intestine is the cecum, a sac-like structure that is suspended inferior to the ileocecal valve. It is about 6 cm (2.4 in) long, receives the contents of the ileum, and continues the absorption of water and salts. The appendix (or vermiform appendix) is a winding tube that attaches to the cecum. Although the 7.6-cm (3-in) long appendix contains lymphoid tissue, suggesting an immunologic function, this organ is generally considered vestigial. However, at least one recent report postulates a survival advantage conferred by the appendix: In diarrheal illness, the appendix may serve as a bacterial reservoir to repopulate the enteric bacteria for those surviving the initial phases of the illness. Moreover, its twisted anatomy provides a haven for the accumulation and multiplication of enteric bacteria. The mesoappendix, the mesentery of the appendix, tethers it to the mesentery of the ileum."}

{"prompt":"Question: Evolution happens because of what?\nOptions:\n A. natural resources\nB. natural selection\nC. natural change\nD. natural process","completion":"natural selection\nExplanation: Evolution happens because of natural selection . Good traits become more common in a population. Bad traits become less common. The deer mouse, species Peromyscus maniculatus gives an example of evolution by natural selection. In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown. But in places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the darker soil, the mice are light. Why? Because predators could more easily spot the dark mice on light sand. The lighter mice were more likely to survive and have offspring. Natural selection favored the light mice. Over time, the population became light colored. Enough changes may take place over time that the two types of mice become different species."}

{"prompt":"Question: What controls the opening to the airway and gut?\nOptions:\n A. mandible\nB. tongue\nC. teeth\nD. electrons","completion":"mandible\nExplanation: Although it is not found in the skull, the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton. The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck. It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and tongue. The mandible articulates with the base of the skull. The mandible controls the opening to the airway and gut. In animals with teeth, the mandible brings the surfaces of the teeth in contact with the maxillary teeth. The Vertebral Column The vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck. The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx bones. In the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into one. The coccyx is typically 3\u20134 vertebrae that fuse into one. Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together. We begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together. The adult vertebrae are further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figure 38.8)."}

When a person has pneumonia, gas exchange cannot occur properly across the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by many things. Infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can cause pneumonia. An injury caused by chemicals or a physical injury to the lungs can also cause pneumonia. Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics."}
{"prompt":"Question: The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of what?\nOptions:\n A. bile ducts\nB. stomach cilia\nC. alveoli\nD. intestinal villi","completion":"intestinal villi\nExplanation: Absorption The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi. The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine. Almost all ingested food, 80 percent of electrolytes, and 90 percent of water are absorbed in the small intestine. Although the entire small intestine is involved in the absorption of water and lipids, most absorption of carbohydrates and proteins occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes from the ileum into the large intestine, it is essentially indigestible food residue (mainly plant fibers like cellulose), some water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32)."}

{"prompt":"Question: In which organ of the body does gluconeogenesis primarily take place?\nOptions:\n A. liver\nB. kidney\nC. spleen\nD. heart","completion":"liver\nExplanation: Gluconeogenesis Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of new glucose molecules from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, or the amino acids alanine or glutamine. This process takes place primarily in the liver during periods of low glucose, that is, under conditions of fasting, starvation, and low carbohydrate diets. So, the question can be raised as to why the body would create something it has just spent a fair amount of effort to break down? Certain key organs, including the brain, can use only glucose as an energy source; therefore, it is essential that the body maintain a minimum blood glucose concentration. When the blood glucose concentration falls below that certain point, new glucose is synthesized by the liver to raise the blood concentration to normal. Gluconeogenesis is not simply the reverse of glycolysis. There are some important differences (Figure 24.10). Pyruvate is a common starting material for gluconeogenesis. First, the pyruvate is converted into oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate then serves as a substrate for the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which transforms oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). From this step, gluconeogenesis is nearly the reverse of glycolysis. PEP is converted back into 2-phosphoglycerate, which is converted into 3-phosphoglycerate. Then, 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate and then into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate then combine to form fructose-1-6-bisphosphate, which is converted into fructose 6-phosphate and then into glucose-6-phosphate. Finally, a series of reactions generates glucose itself. In gluconeogenesis (as compared to glycolysis), the enzyme hexokinase is replaced by glucose-6-phosphatase, and the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is replaced by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This helps the cell to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis independently of each other. As will be discussed as part of lipolysis, fats can be broken down into glycerol, which can be phosphorylated to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate or DHAP. DHAP can either enter the glycolytic pathway or be used by the liver as a substrate for gluconeogenesis."}

Peripheral proteins can also be attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can stick into a small portion of the lipid bilayer by themselves. Peripheral membrane proteins are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors. Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic."}
{"prompt":"Question: Because it can be controlled intentionally, skeletal muscle is also called what type of muscle?\nOptions:\n A. automatic\nB. voluntary\nC. necessary\nD. involuntary","completion":"voluntary\nExplanation: Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones and sometimes the skin and control locomotion and any other movement that can be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled intentionally, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle. When viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated appearance. This appearance results from the arrangement of the proteins inside the cell that are responsible for contraction. The cells of skeletal muscle are long and tapered and have multiple nuclei on the periphery of each cell. Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around passages such as in the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, and is called involuntary muscle. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus. Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart. The contractions of cardiac muscle tissue pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. The cells of cardiac muscle tissue are connected to each other through intercalated disks and usually have just one nucleus per cell."}
{"prompt":"Question: The challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of what?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. bacteria\nC. acids\nD. particles","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: The challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. Although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern.

{"prompt":"Question: Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. in addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in this?\nOptions:\n A. isolation\nB. water\nC. substrate\nD. colonies","completion":"isolation\nExplanation: Microbial Genomics: Metagenomics Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species."}

{"prompt":"Question: Chlorine and bromine gases released into the atmosphere have helped damage what layer of the atmosphere?\nOptions:\n A. stratospheric layer\nB. ozone layer\nC. carbon layer\nD. polluted layer","completion":"ozone layer\nExplanation: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk."}
{"prompt":"Question: Because several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to determining height in humans, height is considered what kind of trait?\nOptions:\n A. adaptive\nB. polygenic\nC. maladaptive\nD. epigenetic","completion":"polygenic\nExplanation: An example of a human polygenic trait is adult height. Several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to this trait, so there are many possible adult heights. For example, one adult\u2019s height might be 1.655 m (5.430 feet), and another adult\u2019s height might be 1.656 m (5.433 feet) tall.

{"prompt":"Question: Which germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body?\nOptions:\n A. histone and melatonin\nB. endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm\nC. keratinocytes , ectoderm , mesoderm\nD. cytoplasm and chloroplasm","completion":"endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm\nExplanation: The three germ layers are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm. Cells in each germ layer differentiate into tissues and embryonic organs. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis, among other tissues. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body. The endoderm gives rise to the gut and many internal organs. Organogenesis Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise during further development to the different organs in the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organs develop from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes that will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will take on the shape and characteristics of epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is regulated by location-specific chemical signals from the cell\u2019s embryonic environment that sets in play a cascade of events that regulates gene expression."}
{"prompt":"Question: Sedimentary rocks form in what kind of layers?\nOptions:\n A. stacked\nB. magnetic\nC. vertical\nD. horizontal","completion":"horizontal\nExplanation: Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers.

{"prompt":"Question: An unknown genotype can be determined by observing what, the term for characteristics of the resulting offspring?\nOptions:\n A. abnormalities\nB. clusters\nC. phenotypes\nD. chromosonal variations","completion":"phenotypes\nExplanation: Consider the following example: Suppose you have a purple and white flower and purple color ( P ) is dominant to white ( p ). The white flower must be homozygous for the recessive allele, but the genotype of the purple flower is unknown. It could be either PP or Pp . A testcross will determine the organism's genotype. The unknown genotype can be determined by observing the phenotypes of the resulting offspring. If crossing the unknown dominant phenotype ( PP or Pp genotype) individual with the recessive phenotype individual produces only dominant phenotypes (no recessive), then the unknown individual is homozygous dominant. If any recessive phenotypic individuals result from the cross, then the unknown individual must carry the recessive allele, and have the heterozygous genotype."}

{"prompt":"Question: What bonds cause water to have a high boiling point, leaving most water on earth in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state?\nOptions:\n A. potassium bonds\nB. carbon bonds\nC. helium bonds\nD. hydrogen bonds","completion":"hydrogen bonds\nExplanation: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass\/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for when two opposing processes reach the same speed, resulting in no overall change?\nOptions:\n A. neutralization\nB. equilibrium\nC. acceleration\nD. homeostasis","completion":"equilibrium\nExplanation: Imagine you are stranded in a rowboat in the middle of the ocean. Suddenly, your boat springs a small leak, and you need to bail out water. You grab a bucket and begin to bail. After a few minutes, your efforts against the leak keep the water to only about half an inch, but any further bailing doesn\u2019t change the water level; the leak brings in as much water as you bail out. You are at equilibrium. Two opposing processes have reached the same speed, and there is no more overall change in the process. Chemical reactions are like that as well. Most of them come to an equilibrium. The actual position of the equilibrium\u2014whether it favors the reactants or the products\u2014is characteristic of a chemical reaction; it is difficult to see just by looking at the balanced chemical equation. But chemistry has tools to help you understand the equilibrium of chemical reactions\u2014the focus of our study in this chapter. So far in this text, when we present a chemical reaction, we have implicitly assumed that the reaction goes to completion. Indeed, our stoichiometric calculations were based on this; when we asked how much of a product is produced when so much of a reactant reacts, we are assuming that all of a reactant reacts. However, this is usually not the case; many reactions do not go to completion, and many chemists have to deal with that. In this chapter, we will study this phenomenon and see ways in which we can affect the extent of chemical reactions."}

{"prompt":"Question: All polar compounds contain what type of bonds?\nOptions:\n A. balanced\nB. strong\nC. polar\nD. weak","completion":"polar\nExplanation: Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial negative charge on one side of each molecule and a partial positive charge on the other side. All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar. ) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. This explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial positive charge."}

{"prompt":"Question: What weather events move with the prevailing winds and originate in the trade winds in the northern hemisphere?\nOptions:\n A. tsunamis\nB. earthquakes\nC. droughts\nD. hurricanes","completion":"hurricanes\nExplanation: Hurricanes move with the prevailing winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, they originate in the trade winds and are blown to the west. When they reach the westerlies, they switch direction. So they travel toward the north or northeast. You can look at a map of hurricane tracks to see this happen ( Figure below ). Hurricanes may cover 800 km (500 miles) in one day."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you call a condition caused by mutations in one or more genes?\nOptions:\n A. intrinsic disorder\nB. mutation disorder\nC. evolutionary disorder\nD. genetic disorder","completion":"genetic disorder\nExplanation: Mutations can result in errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. These can obviously result in harm to the cell and organism. To function correctly and maintain homeostasis , each cell depends on thousands of proteins to all work together to perform the functions of the cell. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the cell, the cell, tissue, organ, or organ system may not function properly, resulting in a medical condition. A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder or genetic disease. However, only a small percentage of mutations cause genetic disorders; most have no impact on health. If a mutation does not change the protein sequence or structure, resulting in the same function, it will have no effect on the cell. Often, these mutations are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair mistakes in DNA ( Figure below ). Because DNA can be damaged or mutated in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the cell protects itself to maintain proper function."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a gram stain used to identify ?\nOptions:\n A. radioactivity\nB. acids or bases\nC. different types of liquids\nD. different types of bacteria","completion":"different types of bacteria\nExplanation: Different types of bacteria stain a different color when Gram stain is applied to them.

There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the lowest energy state of the atom called?\nOptions:\n A. work state\nB. active state\nC. ground state\nD. base state","completion":"ground state\nExplanation: The electrons in an atom tend to be arranged in such a way that the energy of the atom is as low as possible. The ground state of an atom is the lowest energy state of the atom. When those atoms are given energy, the electrons absorb the energy and move to a higher energy level. These energy levels of the electrons in atoms are quantized, meaning again that the electron must move from one energy level to another in discrete steps rather than continuously. An excited state of an atom is a state where its potential energy is higher than the ground state. An atom in the excited state is not stable. When it returns back to the ground state, it releases the energy that it had previously gained in the form of electromagnetic radiation."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum in mammals' brains called?\nOptions:\n A. the neocortex\nB. the midbrain\nC. the neural\nD. cerebral cortex","completion":"the neocortex\nExplanation: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do people apply to their lawns that causes water pollution?\nOptions:\n A. chemicals\nB. seeds\nC. manure\nD. water","completion":"chemicals\nExplanation: People pollute water when they apply excess chemicals to their lawn.

{"prompt":"Question: Why do players with more mass often have a larger impact in football?\nOptions:\n A. potential energy is lower\nB. kinetic energy is lower\nC. Velocity is larger\nD. momentum is larger","completion":"momentum is larger\nExplanation: Figure 28.18 Momentum is an important concept for these football players from the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at Davis. Players with more mass often have a larger impact because their momentum is larger. For objects moving at relativistic speeds, the effect is even greater. (credit: John Martinez Pavliga)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally?\nOptions:\n A. arthritis\nB. hemophilia\nC. diabetes\nD. lymphoma","completion":"hemophilia\nExplanation: Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process."}

{"prompt":"Question: Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells doing what?\nOptions:\n A. dividing\nB. multiplication\nC. friction\nD. limiting","completion":"dividing\nExplanation: Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? The primary difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis is to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the parent cell. Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the previous cells. The goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as gametes . The resulting gametes are not genetically identical to the parent cell. Gametes are haploid cells, with only half the DNA present in the diploid parent cell. This is necessary so that when a sperm and an egg combine at fertilization , the resulting zygote has the correct amount of DNA\u2014not twice as much as the parents. The zygote then begins to divide through mitosis."}
{"prompt":"Question: Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, which produces what?\nOptions:\n A. life\nB. precipitation\nC. cold\nD. heat","completion":"heat\nExplanation: You know that friction produces heat. That\u2019s why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why the rubbing produces heat? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match (see Figure below ). On the other hand, heat from friction can be a problem inside a car engine. It can cause the car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts and makes them slippery so there is less friction."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which property can you study by comparing the mass of an object relative to its size?\nOptions:\n A. density\nB. volume\nC. weight\nD. motion","completion":"density\nExplanation: A golf ball and a table tennis ball are about the same size. However, the golf ball is much heavier than the table tennis ball. Now imagine a similar size ball made out of lead. That would be very heavy indeed! What are we comparing? By comparing the mass of an object relative to its size, we are studying a property called density. Density is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a force that opposes motion?\nOptions:\n A. tension\nB. momentum\nC. thrust\nD. friction","completion":"friction\nExplanation: Friction is a force that opposes motion. Any two objects in contact have what is called a mutual coefficient of friction. To find the force of friction between them, we multiply the normal force by this coefficient. Like the forces above, it arises due to electromagnetic interactions of atoms in two objects. There are actually two coefficients of friction: static and kinetic. Static friction will oppose initial motion of two objects relative to each other. Once the objects are moving, however, kinetic friction will oppose their continuing motion. Kinetic friction is lower than static friction, so it is easier to keep an object in motion than to set it in motion. There are some things about friction that are not very intuitive:."}
{"prompt":"Question: The name of the cation comes first, followed by the name of the anion, in what kind of compound?\nOptions:\n A. magnetic compound\nB. localized compound\nC. ionic compound\nD. covalent bonds","completion":"ionic compound\nExplanation: Names of ionic compounds are derived from the names of the ions, with the name of the cation coming first, followed by the name of the anion. If an element can form cations of different charges, there are two alternate systems for indicating the compound\u2019s name. In the Stock system, a roman numeral in parentheses indicates the charge on the cation. An example is the name for FeCl2, which is iron(II) chloride. In the common system, the suffixes -ous and -ic are used to stand for the lower and higher possible charge of the cation, respectively. These suffixes are attached to a stem representing the element (which frequently comes from the Latin form of the element name). An example is the common name for FeCl2, which is ferrous chloride. The formula mass of an ionic compound is the sum of the masses of each individual atom in the formula. Care must be taken when calculating formula masses for formulas containing multiple polyatomic ions because the subscript outside the parentheses refers to all the atoms in the polyatomic ion."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which organisms break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell?\nOptions:\n A. photoreactive organisms\nB. chemotrophic organisms\nC. asexual organisms\nD. spicule organisms","completion":"chemotrophic organisms\nExplanation: Chemotrophic organisms break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell. Some chemotrophic organisms can also use their organic energy-supplying molecules as a carbon supply, which would make them chemoheterotrophs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the the most efficient possible engine?\nOptions:\n A. carnot engine\nB. excitation engine\nC. diesel engine\nD. ventilation engine","completion":"carnot engine\nExplanation: An ideal engine, the most efficient theoretically possible, is called a Carnot Engine. Its efficiency is given by the following formula, where the temperatures are, respectively, the temperature of the exhaust environment and the temperature of the heat input, in Kelvins. In a Carnot engine heat is input and exhausted in isothermal cycles, and the efficiency is . In all real engines heat is lost to the environment, thus the ideal efficiency is never even close to being obtained."}
{"prompt":"Question: In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo which other form of cleavage?\nOptions:\n A. straight\nB. diagonal\nC. dispersive\nD. determinate","completion":"determinate\nExplanation: There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes. In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage. This means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined. A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type. In contrast, deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage, in which cells are not yet pre-determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types. These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells. This characteristic of deuterostomes is reflected in the existence of familiar embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type until their fate is programmed at a later developmental stage."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where does the natural synthesis of lactose occur?\nOptions:\n A. ovarian tissue\nB. nervous tissue\nC. liver tissue\nD. mammary tissue","completion":"mammary tissue\nExplanation: Lactose Lactose is known as milk sugar because it occurs in the milk of humans, cows, and other mammals. In fact, the natural synthesis of lactose occurs only in mammary tissue, whereas most other carbohydrates are plant products. Human milk contains about 7.5% lactose, and cow\u2019s milk contains about 4.5%. This sugar is one of the lowest ranking in terms of sweetness, being about one-sixth as sweet as sucrose (seeTable 16.1 \"The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)\" in Section 16.3 \"Important Hexoses\"). Lactose is produced commercially from whey, a by-product in the manufacture of cheese. It is important as an infant food and in the production of penicillin. Lactose is a reducing sugar composed of one molecule of D-galactose and one molecule of D-glucose joined by a \u03b2-1,4-glycosidic bond (the bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit being directed upward). The two monosaccharides are obtained from lactose by acid hydrolysis or the catalytic action of the enzyme lactase:."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for animals that defend their area?\nOptions:\n A. predatory\nB. Grazing\nC. contain\nD. territorial","completion":"territorial\nExplanation: Some species of animals are territorial . This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Having a larger territory could mean more prey or food."}

{"prompt":"Question: The major component of a solution is called what?\nOptions:\n A. solute\nB. mixture\nC. water\nD. solvent","completion":"solvent\nExplanation: The major component of a solution is called the solvent. The minor component of a solution is called the solute. By major and minor we mean whichever component has the greater presence by mass or by moles. Sometimes this becomes confusing, especially with substances with very different molar masses. However, here we will confine the discussion to solutions for which the major component and the minor component are obvious. Solutions exist for every possible phase of the solute and the solvent. Salt water, for example, is a solution of solid NaCl in liquid water; soda water is a solution of gaseous CO2 in liquid water, while air is a solution of a gaseous solute (O2) in a gaseous solvent (N2). In all cases, however, the overall phase of the solution is the same phase as the solvent."}
{"prompt":"Question: Water is recycled constantly through which system?\nOptions:\n A. the ecosystem\nB. the hydropshere\nC. the habitat\nD. the troposphere","completion":"the ecosystem\nExplanation: Water is recycled constantly through the ecosystem.

{"prompt":"Question: When you change a magnetic field through electromagnetic induction what do you create?\nOptions:\n A. cooling current\nB. microwave current\nC. electric current\nD. Light Current","completion":"electric current\nExplanation: The process of generating electric current with a changing magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction . It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses magnetic field lines. One way this can happen is pictured in Figure below . It shows a magnet moving inside a wire coil. Another way is for the coil to move instead of the magnet."}

{"prompt":"Question: A red blood cell will swell and burst when placed in a?\nOptions:\n A. acidic solution\nB. exothermic solution\nC. hypotonic solution\nD. dissolved solution","completion":"hypotonic solution\nExplanation: A cell that does not have a rigid cell wall, such as a red blood cell, will swell and lyse (burst) when placed in a hypotonic solution. Cells with a cell wall will swell when placed in a hypotonic solution, but once the cell is turgid (firm), the tough cell wall prevents any more water from entering the cell. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a cell without a cell wall will lose water to the environment, shrivel, and probably die. In a hypertonic solution, a cell with a cell wall will lose water too. The plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall as it shrivels, a process called plasmolysis . Animal cells tend to do best in an isotonic environment, plant cells tend to do best in a hypotonic environment. This is demonstrated in Figure below ."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the area where an electron is most likely to be found called?\nOptions:\n A. neutron\nB. proton\nC. neucleus\nD. orbital","completion":"orbital\nExplanation: wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital. Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom\u2019s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letter s, p, d, and f. The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital, which can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital."}

All substances have characteristic densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance you have."}
{"prompt":"Question: What theory explains most of the features of earth\u2019s surface?\nOptions:\n A. Big Bang theory\nB. flat earth theory\nC. plate tectonics\nD. string theory","completion":"plate tectonics\nExplanation: The theory of plate tectonics explains most of the features of Earth\u2019s surface. Plate tectonics helps us to understand where and why mountains form. Using the theory, we know where new ocean floor will be created and where it will be destroyed. We know why earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen where they do. We even can search for mineral resources using information about past plate motions. Plate tectonics is the key that unlocks many of the mysteries of our amazing planet."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the transfer of thermal energy?\nOptions:\n A. formation\nB. heat\nC. humidity\nD. precipitation","completion":"heat\nExplanation: Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles of matter. The transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Therefore, a heating system is a system for the transfer of thermal energy. Regardless of the type of heating system in a home, the basic function is the same: to produce thermal energy and transfer it to air throughout the house."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field?\nOptions:\n A. potential energy\nB. solar energy\nC. mechanical energy\nD. thermal energy","completion":"potential energy\nExplanation: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity."}
{"prompt":"Question: The force that blood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or upon the chambers of the heart is known as blood what?\nOptions:\n A. pressure\nB. squeeze\nC. push\nD. vaccuum","completion":"pressure\nExplanation: 20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance Blood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ. The slowing or blocking of blood flow is called resistance. Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or chambers of the heart. The components of blood pressure include systolic pressure, which results from ventricular contraction, and diastolic pressure, which results from ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic measures, and mean arterial pressure is the \u201caverage\u201d pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood into the tissues. Pulse, the expansion and recoiling of an artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the systemic circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of the blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant factor in systemic blood pressure: Slight vasodilation greatly decreases resistance and increases flow, whereas slight vasoconstriction greatly increases resistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and flow decreases. In the venous system, constriction increases blood pressure as it does in arteries; the increasing pressure helps to return blood to the heart. In addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to become more rounded, decreasing resistance and increasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with the skeletal muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and their valves to promote venous return to the heart."}
{"prompt":"Question: The thin scale-like or flat shape of what cells fits their primary function, to provide a smooth and protective surface?\nOptions:\n A. technique epithelium\nB. kind epithelium\nC. simple epithelium\nD. basic epithelium","completion":"simple epithelium\nExplanation: Simple Epithelium The shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in simple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal, and elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the lymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous epithelium, because of the thinness of the cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed. The alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of simple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is a simple squamous epithelium that forms the surface layer of the serous membrane that lines body cavities and internal organs. Its primary function is to provide a smooth and protective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells that secrete a fluid that lubricates the mesothelium. In simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the center of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia are observed in the lining of the kidney tubules and in the ducts of glands."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are carbonated beverages pressurized with?\nOptions:\n A. helium\nB. dioxide\nC. hydrogen\nD. co2","completion":"co2\nExplanation: NaN3 is 1.847 g\/cm . What is the volume of the gas produced compared to the solid reactant? Suggest a plausible reason to explain why skin burns can result from the inflation of an airbag during an automobile accident. Under basic conditions, the reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) produces oxygen and manganese dioxide. During a laboratory exercise, you carefully weighed out your sample of KMnO4. Unfortunately, however, you lost your data just before mixing the KMnO 4 with an H2O2 solution of unknown concentration. Devise a method to determine the mass of your sample of KMnO4 using excess H2O2. Carbonated beverages are pressurized with CO 2. In an attempt to produce another bubbly soda beverage, an intrepid chemist attempted to use three other gases: He, N 2, and Xe.

{"prompt":"Question: What plant products may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin?\nOptions:\n A. flowers\nB. pods\nC. fruits\nD. leaves","completion":"fruits\nExplanation: Fruits may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin (Figure 32.22). If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as a simple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans. An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry. Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. An example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit. Accessory fruits (sometimes called false fruits) are not derived from the ovary, but from another part of the flower, such as the receptacle (strawberry) or the hypanthium (apples and pears)."}
{"prompt":"Question: The human heart is located within what cavity?\nOptions:\n A. thoracic\nB. pelvic\nC. spinal\nD. abdominal","completion":"thoracic\nExplanation: Location of the Heart The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the mediastinum. Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity. Within the mediastinum, the heart is separated from the other mediastinal structures by a tough membrane known as the pericardium, or pericardial sac, and sits in its own space called the pericardial cavity. The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages. The great veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the superior surface of the heart, called the base. The base of the heart is located at the level of the third costal cartilage, as seen in Figure 19.2. The inferior tip of the heart, the apex, lies just to the left of the sternum between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages. The right side of the heart is deflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly. It is important to remember the position and orientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also when looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective. The slight deviation of the apex to the left is reflected in a depression in the medial surface of the inferior lobe of the left lung, called the cardiac notch."}

{"prompt":"Question: Making ups about 50 percent of the modern american diet, what food group can be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars and\/or complex sugars?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. carbohydrates\nC. fats\nD. grains","completion":"carbohydrates\nExplanation: Carbohydrate Digestion The average American diet is about 50 percent carbohydrates, which may be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and\/or complex sugars (polysaccharides). Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the three monosaccharides that are commonly consumed and are readily absorbed. Your digestive system is also able to break down the disaccharide sucrose (regular table sugar: glucose + fructose), lactose (milk sugar: glucose + galactose), and maltose (grain sugar: glucose + glucose), and the polysaccharides glycogen and starch (chains of monosaccharides). Your bodies do not produce enzymes that can break down most fibrous polysaccharides, such as cellulose. While indigestible polysaccharides do not provide any nutritional value, they do provide dietary fiber, which helps propel food through the alimentary canal. The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure 23.29). After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme \u03b1-dextrinase starts working on \u03b1dextrin, breaking off one glucose unit at a time. Three brush border enzymes hydrolyze sucrose, lactose, and maltose into monosaccharides. Sucrase splits sucrose into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose; maltase breaks down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactase breaks down lactose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. Insufficient lactase can lead to lactose intolerance."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the theoretical event that began the universe often called?\nOptions:\n A. Coreolis effect\nB. dark matter\nC. big bang\nD. string theory","completion":"big bang\nExplanation: The generation of an isolated but open system, which we might call a protocell, was a critical step in the origin of life. Such an isolated system has important properties that are likely to have facilitated the further development of life. For example, because of the membrane boundary, changes that occur within one such structure will not be shared with neighboring systems. Rather, they accumulated in, and favor the survival of, one system over its neighbors. Such systems can also reproduce in a crude way by fragmentation. If changes within one such system improved its stability, its ability to accumulate resources, or its ability to survive and reproduce, that system, and its progeny, would be likely to become more common. As these changes accumulate and are passed from parent to offspring, the organisms will inevitably evolve, as we will see in detail in the next chapter. As in living systems today, the earliest steps in the formation of the first organisms required a source of energy to maintain the non-equilibrium living system. There are really two choices for the source of this energy, either light (electromagnetic radiation from the sun) or thermodynamically unstable chemicals present in the environment. There have been a number of plausible scenarios, based on various observations, for the steps leading to life. For example, a recent study based on the analysis of the genes (and the proteins that they encode) found in modern organisms, suggests that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) arose in association with hydrothermal vents.60 But whether this reflects LUCA or an ancestor of LUCA that became adapted to living is association with hydrothermal vents is difficult (and perhaps impossible) to resolve unambiguously, particularly since LUCA lived ~3.4-3.8 billion years ago and cannot be studied directly. Mapping the history of life on earth Assuming, as seems likely, that life arose spontaneously, we can now look at what we know about the fossil record to better understand the diversification of life and life\u2019s impact on the Earth. This is probably best done by starting with what we know about where the Universe and Earth came from. The current scientific model for the origin of the universe is known as the \u201cBig Bang\u201d (also known as the \u201cprimeval atom\u201d or the \u201ccosmic egg\u201d), an idea originally proposed by the priest, physicist and astronomer Georges Lema\u00eetre (1894-1966).61 The Big Bang model arose from efforts to answer the question of whether the fuzzy nebulae identified by astronomers were located within or outside of our galaxy. This required some way to determine how far these nebulae were from Earth. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) and his co-workers were the first to realize that nebulae were in fact galaxies in their own right, each very much like our own Milky Way and each is composed of many billions of stars. This was a surprising result. It made Earth, sitting on the edge of one (the Milky Way) among many, many galaxies seem less important \u2013 a change in cosmological perspective similar to that associated with the idea that the Sun, rather than Earth, was the center of the solar system (and the Universe). To measure the movement of galaxies with respect to Earth, Hubble and colleagues combined to types of observations. The first of these allowed them to estimate the distance from the Earth to."}
{"prompt":"Question: Substances that act as both weak acids and bases are said to be what?\nOptions:\n A. amphiphilic\nB. amphoteric\nC. hygroscopic\nD. atmospheric","completion":"amphoteric\nExplanation: Other applications of carbonates include glass making\u2014where carbonate ions serve as a source of oxide ions\u2014and synthesis of oxides. Hydrogen carbonates are amphoteric because they act as both weak acids and weak bases. Hydrogen carbonate ions act as acids and react with solutions of soluble hydroxides to form a carbonate and water: KHCO 3(aq) + KOH(aq) \u27f6 K 2 CO 3(aq) + H 2 O(l) With acids, hydrogen carbonates form a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. Baking soda (bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate) is sodium hydrogen carbonate. Baking powder contains baking soda and a solid acid such as potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar), KHC4H4O6. As long as the powder is dry, no reaction occurs; immediately after the addition of water, the acid reacts with the hydrogen carbonate ions to form carbon dioxide: HC 4 H 4 O 6 \u2212(aq) + HCO 3 \u2212(aq) \u27f6 C 4 H 4 O 6 2\u2212(aq) + CO 2(g) + H 2 O(l) Dough will trap the carbon dioxide, causing it to expand during baking, producing the characteristic texture of baked goods."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of contamination causes almost 90% of diarrheal disease worldwide?\nOptions:\n A. air contamination\nB. ground contamination\nC. water supply contamination\nD. food contamination","completion":"water supply contamination\nExplanation: Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health. Waterborne diseases are diseases due to microscopic pathogens in fresh water. These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and intestinal parasites. In many parts of the world there are no water treatment plants. If sewage or animal manure gets into a river, then people downstream will get sick when they drink the water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is responsible for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It was estimated that 88% of the cases of diarrheal disease are caused by unsafe water supplies."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the two types of photoreceptors in the retina?\nOptions:\n A. holes and cones\nB. circles and cones\nC. images and cones\nD. rods and cones","completion":"rods and cones\nExplanation: Which of the following statements about the human eye is false? a. Rods detect color, while cones detect only shades of gray. When light enters the retina, it passes the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before reaching photoreceptors at the rear of the eye. The iris adjusts the amount of light coming into the eye. The cornea is a protective layer on the front of the eye. The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. The lens is dynamic, focusing and refocusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field. The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina. With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results. Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina. Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short. For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina. In this case, images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear. There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in Figure 36.18. Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina. They detect dim light and are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision. Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of the retina. They respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision."}

{"prompt":"Question: When the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent, we say that the solution is what?\nOptions:\n A. saturated\nB. blended\nC. used\nD. empty","completion":"saturated\nExplanation: When the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent, we say that the solution is saturated with solute. When less than the maximum amount of solute is dissolved in a given amount of solute, the solution is unsaturated. These terms are also qualitative terms because each solute has its own solubility. A solution of 0.00019 g of AgCl per 100 g of H2O may be saturated, but with so little solute dissolved, it is also rather dilute. A solution of 36.1 g of NaCl in 100 g of H2O is also saturated but rather concentrated. Ideally, we need more precise ways of specifying the amount of solute in a solution. We will introduce such ways in Section 11.2 \"Quantitative Units of Concentration\". In some circumstances, it is possible to dissolve more than the maximum amount of a solute in a solution. Usually, this happens by heating the solvent, dissolving more solute than would normally dissolve at regular temperatures, and letting the solution cool down slowly and carefully. Such solutions are called supersaturated solutions and are not stable; given an opportunity (such as dropping a crystal of solute in the solution), the excess solute will precipitate from the solution. It should be obvious that some solutes dissolve in certain solvents but not others. NaCl, for example, dissolves in water but not in vegetable oil. Beeswax dissolves in liquid hexane but not water. What is it that makes a solute soluble in some solvents but not others? The answer is intermolecular interactions. The intermolecular interactions include London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding (as described in Chapter 10 \"Solids and Liquids\"). From experimental studies, it has been determined that if molecules of a solute experience the Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the name for the point reached at a ph of 7?\nOptions:\n A. equivalence point\nB. analogous point\nC. acidic point\nD. constriction point","completion":"equivalence point\nExplanation: As base is added to acid at the beginning of a titration, the pH rises very slowly. Nearer to the equivalence point, the pH begins to rapidly increase. If the titration is a strong acid with a strong base, the pH at the equivalence point is equal to 7. A bit past the equivalence point, the rate of change of the pH again slows down. A titration curve is a graphical representation of the pH of a solution during a titration. The Figure below shows two different examples of a strong acid-strong base titration curve. On the left is a titration in which the base is added to the acid and so the pH progresses from low to high. On the right is a titration in which the acid is added to the base. In this case, the pH starts out high and decreases during the titration. In both cases, the equivalence point is reached when the moles of acid and base are equal and the pH is 7. This also corresponds to the color change of the indicator."}
{"prompt":"Question: Dalton's law and henry's law both describe aspects of what type of exchange?\nOptions:\n A. energy\nB. electron\nC. liquid\nD. gas","completion":"gas\nExplanation: 22.4 Gas Exchange The behavior of gases can be explained by the principles of Dalton\u2019s law and Henry\u2019s law, both of which describe aspects of gas exchange. Dalton\u2019s law states that each specific gas in a mixture of gases exerts force (its partial pressure) independently of the other gases in the mixture. Henry\u2019s law states that the amount of a specific gas that dissolves in a liquid is a function of its partial pressure. The greater the partial pressure of a gas, the more of that gas will dissolve in a liquid, as the gas moves toward equilibrium. Gas molecules move down a pressure gradient; in other words, gas moves from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen is high in the alveoli and low in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries. As a result, oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveoli into the blood. In contrast, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is high in the pulmonary capillaries and low in the alveoli. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the blood into the alveoli. The amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide that diffuses across the respiratory membrane is similar. Ventilation is the process that moves air into and out of the alveoli, and perfusion affects the flow of blood in the capillaries. Both are important in gas exchange, as ventilation must be sufficient to create a high partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. If ventilation is insufficient and the partial pressure of oxygen drops in the alveolar air, the capillary is constricted and blood flow is redirected to alveoli with sufficient ventilation. External respiration refers to gas exchange that occurs in the alveoli, whereas internal respiration refers to gas exchange that occurs in the tissue. Both are driven by partial pressure differences."}

{"prompt":"Question: Animals that are endotherms or ectotherms are distinguished by the ability to maintain a constant what?\nOptions:\n A. step temperature\nB. bearing temperature\nC. Moving Tempature\nD. body temperature","completion":"body temperature\nExplanation: Endotherms and Ectotherms Animals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environment. Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms. This group has been called cold-blooded, but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. In contrast to ectotherms, which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm. Endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes in temperature. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme levels of activity."}

{"prompt":"Question: What happens to the recessive traits in the offspring of a hybridization?\nOptions:\n A. they dominate\nB. remain recessive\nC. they disappear\nD. they replicate","completion":"they disappear\nExplanation: Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into expressed and latent traits. He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits. Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization. The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the F1 generation. Mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic."}

{"prompt":"Question: What makes luminous dials glow in the dark?\nOptions:\n A. polymer substances\nB. devil substances\nC. phosphorescent substances\nD. eerie substances","completion":"phosphorescent substances\nExplanation: Once excited, an atom or molecule will usually spontaneously de-excite quickly. (The electrons raised to higher levels are attracted to lower ones by the positive charge of the nucleus. ) Spontaneous de-excitation has a very short mean lifetime of \u22128 typically about 10 s . However, some levels have significantly longer lifetimes, ranging up to milliseconds to minutes or even hours. These energy levels are inhibited and are slow in de-exciting because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower levels. Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms, they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and, thus, are said to be metastable, meaning relatively stable. Phosphorescence is the de-excitation of a metastable state. Glow-in-the-dark materials, such as luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children\u2019s toys and pajamas, are made of phosphorescent substances. Visible light excites the atoms or molecules to metastable states that decay slowly, releasing the stored excitation energy partially as visible light. In some ceramics, atomic excitation energy can be frozen in after the ceramic has cooled from its firing. It is very slowly released, but the ceramic can be induced to phosphoresce by heating\u2014a process called \u201cthermoluminescence. \u201d Since the release is slow, thermoluminescence can be used to date antiquities. The less light emitted, the older the ceramic. (See Figure 30.35."}

This figure shows three relatively complex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells; adenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to the host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to do so. Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope, which help stabilize virion shape. HIV is a retrovirus, which means it reverse transcribes its RNA genome into DNA, which is then spliced into the host\u2019s DNA.

{"prompt":"Question: Gene therapy is a type of what kind of engineering?\nOptions:\n A. mechanical engineering\nB. electrical engineering\nC. genetic engineering\nD. chemical engineering","completion":"genetic engineering\nExplanation: Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality. Genetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases. Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (Figure 17.9). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Respiratory distress syndrome results from insufficient production of what?\nOptions:\n A. pulmonary surfactant\nB. carbon dioxide\nC. alveoli\nD. lung tissue","completion":"pulmonary surfactant\nExplanation: Respiratory System: Respiratory Distress Syndrome Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) primarily occurs in infants born prematurely. Up to 50 percent of infants born between 26 and 28 weeks and fewer than 30 percent of infants born between 30 and 31 weeks develop RDS. RDS results from insufficient production of pulmonary surfactant, thereby preventing the lungs from properly inflating at birth. A small amount of pulmonary surfactant is produced beginning at around 20 weeks; however, this is not sufficient for inflation of the lungs. As a result, dyspnea occurs and gas exchange cannot be performed properly. Blood oxygen levels are low, whereas blood carbon dioxide levels and pH are high. The primary cause of RDS is premature birth, which may be due to a variety of known or unknown causes. Other risk factors include gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, second-born twins, and family history of RDS. The presence of RDS can lead to other serious disorders, such as septicemia (infection of the blood) or pulmonary hemorrhage. Therefore, it is important that RDS is immediately recognized and treated to prevent death and reduce the risk of developing other disorders. Medical advances have resulted in an improved ability to treat RDS and support the infant until proper lung development can occur. At the time of delivery, treatment may include resuscitation and intubation if the infant does not breathe on his or her own. These infants would need to be placed on a ventilator to mechanically assist with the breathing process. If spontaneous breathing occurs, application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be required. In addition, pulmonary surfactant is typically administered. Death due to RDS has been reduced by 50 percent due to the introduction of pulmonary surfactant therapy. Other therapies may include corticosteroids, supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation. Supportive therapies, such as temperature regulation, nutritional support, and antibiotics, may be administered to the premature infant as well."}

{"prompt":"Question: The part of the ecosystem required by a particular species is endangered when human activity threatens loss of what?\nOptions:\n A. primary producers\nB. primary speciation\nC. habitat\nD. biodiversity","completion":"habitat\nExplanation: Habitat Loss Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural ecosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their habitat\u2014whether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river\u2014will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats (habitats generally refer to the part of the ecosystem required by a particular species) accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra\u2019s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 21.8). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A 5-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1 percent. Much loss (2.4 percent) occurred in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction. These losses certainly also represent the extinction of species unique to those areas."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the most common dietary lipids?\nOptions:\n A. phospholipids\nB. diglycerides\nC. triglycerides\nD. monoglycerides","completion":"triglycerides\nExplanation: Lipid Digestion A healthy diet limits lipid intake to 35 percent of total calorie intake. The most common dietary lipids are triglycerides, which are made up of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acid chains. Small amounts of dietary cholesterol and phospholipids are also consumed. The three lipases responsible for lipid digestion are lingual lipase, gastric lipase, and pancreatic lipase. However, because the pancreas is the only consequential source of lipase, virtually all lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine. Pancreatic lipase breaks down each triglyceride into two free fatty acids and a monoglyceride. The fatty acids include both short-chain (less than 10 to 12 carbons) and long-chain fatty acids."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the functional unit of compact bone?\nOptions:\n A. osteon\nB. spongin\nC. collagen\nD. scleroprotein","completion":"osteon\nExplanation: Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bone. Its functional unit is the osteon . Compact bone is very hard and strong."}
{"prompt":"Question: When do homologous chromosomes separate and go to different gametes?\nOptions:\n A. during electrolysis\nB. before meiosis\nC. after meiosis\nD. during meiosis","completion":"during meiosis\nExplanation: During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different gametes. Thus, the two alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. At the same time, different chromosomes assort independently. As a result, alleles for different genes assort independently as well. In these ways, alleles are shuffled and recombined in each parent\u2019s gametes."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a random change in an organism's genes?\nOptions:\n A. meiosis\nB. mutation\nC. infection\nD. accumulation","completion":"mutation\nExplanation: At some time in the past, a variation probably came from a mutation. A mutation is a random change in an organism's genes ( Figure below ). Mutations are natural. Some are harmful, but many are neutral. If a mutation is harmful, the organism may not live to reproduce. If the mutation is beneficial, that organism may have a better chance to survive. An organism that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the mutation on to its offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive."}
{"prompt":"Question: Respiratory development in the embryo begins around week 4. ectodermal tissue from the anterior head region invaginates posteriorly to form olfactory pits, which fuse with endodermal tissue of the developing pharynx. an olfactory pit is one of a pair of structures that will enlarge to become this?\nOptions:\n A. nasal cavity\nB. anal cavity\nC. eye cavity\nD. fluid cavity","completion":"nasal cavity\nExplanation: Weeks 4\u20137 Respiratory development in the embryo begins around week 4. Ectodermal tissue from the anterior head region invaginates posteriorly to form olfactory pits, which fuse with endodermal tissue of the developing pharynx. An olfactory pit is one of a pair of structures that will enlarge to become the nasal cavity. At about this same time, the lung bud forms. The lung bud is a dome-shaped structure composed of tissue that bulges from the foregut. The foregut is endoderm just inferior to the pharyngeal pouches. The laryngotracheal bud is a structure that forms from the longitudinal extension of the lung bud as development progresses. The portion of this structure nearest the pharynx becomes the trachea, whereas the distal end becomes more bulbous, forming bronchial buds. A bronchial bud is one of a pair of structures that will eventually become the bronchi and all other lower respiratory structures (Figure 22.29)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Nitrogen wastes are produced by the breakdown of what during normal metabolism?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. enzymes\nC. hormones\nD. lipids","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Regulation of Nitrogen Wastes Nitrogen wastes are produced by the breakdown of proteins during normal metabolism. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which in turn are deaminated by having their nitrogen groups removed. Deamination converts the amino (NH2) groups into ammonia (NH3), ammonium ion (NH4+), urea, or uric acid (Figure 25.22). Ammonia is extremely toxic, so most of it is very rapidly converted into urea in the liver. Human urinary wastes typically contain primarily urea with small amounts of ammonium and very little uric acid."}

{"prompt":"Question: The sweat glands of the armpit are classified as these?\nOptions:\n A. mucus glands\nB. apocrine glands\nC. pineal glands\nD. adrenal glands","completion":"apocrine glands\nExplanation: Apocrine secretion accumulates near the apical portion of the cell. That portion of the cell and its secretory contents pinch off from the cell and are released. The sweat glands of the armpit are classified as apocrine glands. Both merocrine and apocrine glands continue to produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus and golgi regions remain intact after secretion. In contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell accumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells in the surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin and hair are holocrine glands\/cells (Figure 4.11)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the long, thin structures that protrude from the cell membrane and help single-celled organisms move or swim towards food?\nOptions:\n A. microvilli\nB. tentacles\nC. sporangia\nD. flagella","completion":"flagella\nExplanation: Flagella ( flagellum , singular) are long, thin structures that protrude from the cell membrane. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can have flagella. Flagella help single-celled organisms move or swim towards food. The flagella of eukaryotic cells are normally used for movement too, such as in the movement of sperm cells, which have only a single flagellum. The flagella of either group are very different from each other. Prokaryotic flagella, shown in Figure below , are spiral-shaped and stiff. They spin around in a fixed base much like a screw does, which moves the cell in a tumbling fashion. Eukaryotic flagella are made of microtubules that bend and flex like a whip."}

{"prompt":"Question: Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. antisaline\nB. stenohaline\nC. trichina\nD. saline intolerant","completion":"stenohaline\nExplanation: Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers Persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in Figure 41.3a. In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in Figure 41.3b. Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers). Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishes\u2019 salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other."}
{"prompt":"Question: Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as?\nOptions:\n A. homeostasis\nB. ketosis\nC. equanimity\nD. consciousness","completion":"homeostasis\nExplanation: When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis . Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in what zone break down dead organisms that sink there?\nOptions:\n A. photic\nB. photoreactive zone\nC. aphotic zone\nD. trophic","completion":"aphotic zone\nExplanation: Lakes and Ponds Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term describes a collection of similar cells that had a common embryonic origin?\nOptions:\n A. tissue\nB. organ-level organization\nC. plasma\nD. nucleus","completion":"tissue\nExplanation: Complex Tissue Structure A hallmark trait of animals is specialized structures that are differentiated to perform unique functions. As multicellular organisms, most animals develop specialized cells that group together into tissues with specialized functions. A tissue is a collection of similar cells that had a common embryonic origin. There are four main types of animal tissues: nervous, muscle, connective, and epithelial. Nervous tissue contains neurons, or nerve cells, which transmit nerve impulses. Muscle tissue contracts to cause all types of body movement from locomotion of the organism to movements within the body itself. Animals also have specialized connective tissues that provide many functions, including transport and structural support. Examples of connective tissues include blood and bone. Connective tissue is comprised of cells separated by extracellular material made of organic and inorganic materials, such as the protein and mineral deposits of bone. Epithelial tissue covers the internal and external surfaces of organs inside the animal body and the external surface of the body of the organism."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do many mollusks secrete for their protection?\nOptions:\n A. mucus\nB. calcareous shell\nC. sedimentation shell\nD. microscopic shell","completion":"calcareous shell\nExplanation: 15.4 Mollusks and Annelids The phylum Mollusca is a large, mainly marine group of invertebrates. Mollusks show a variety of morphologies. Many mollusks secrete a calcareous shell for protection, but in other species, the shell is reduced or absent. Mollusks are protostomes. The dorsal epidermis in mollusks is modified to form the mantle, which encloses the mantle cavity and visceral organs. This cavity is distinct from the coelomic cavity, which the adult animal retains, surrounding the heart. Respiration is facilitated by gills known as ctenidia. A chitinous scraper called the radula is present in most mollusks. Mollusks are mostly dioecious and are divided into seven classes. The phylum Annelida includes worm-like, segmented animals. Segmentation is both external and internal, which is called metamerism. Annelids are protostomes. The presence of chitinous hairs called chaetae is characteristic of most members. These animals have well-developed nervous and digestive systems. Polychaete annelids have parapodia that participate in locomotion and respiration. Suckers are seen in the order Hirudinea. Breeding systems include separate sexes and hermaphroditism."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is it called when breaks in bone occur that is usually caused by excessive stress on the bone?\nOptions:\n A. fragments\nB. faults\nC. fractures\nD. ruptures","completion":"fractures\nExplanation: Fractures are breaks in bone, usually caused by excessive stress on bone. Fractures heal when osteoblasts form new bone. The animation at this link shows how this happens: http:\/\/www. youtube. com\/watch?v=qVougiCEgH8 . Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days, bone cells travel to the break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to three months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site. Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In such a case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins. Moving the broken pieces together will help keep the bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dietary proteins are broken down into what components when food is digested?\nOptions:\n A. organic acids\nB. protein acids\nC. amino acids\nD. polymer acids","completion":"amino acids\nExplanation: Proteins in the diet are necessary for life. Dietary proteins are broken down into their component amino acids when food is digested. Cells can then use the components to build new proteins. Humans are able to synthesize all but nine of the twenty common amino acids. These nine amino acids, called essential amino acids , must be consumed in foods. Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also be broken down to provide cells with energy. The amino acids regarded as essential for humans are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, methionine, leucine, lysine, and histidine. Additionally, cysteine, tyrosine and arginine are required by infants and growing children."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do people build to protect areas from floods?\nOptions:\n A. dams\nB. reinforced walls\nC. drains\nD. sewers","completion":"dams\nExplanation: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood."}

When kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes and fluids. This is a vital process to keep patients alive. In some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a lifelong necessity. Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment development and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. This can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include taking and reporting a patient\u2019s vital signs, preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and sterile procedures."}

{"prompt":"Question: Fermentation\u2014of grains to produce beer, and of fruits to produce wine\u2014is an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for how long?\nOptions:\n A. years\nB. eons\nC. millennia\nD. decades","completion":"millennia\nExplanation: Fermentation\u2014of grains to produce beer, and of fruits to produce wine\u2014is an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for millennia. Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO2 and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer\u2019s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s. This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting. Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years. As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa. Additionally, many important genes originally discovered in S. cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia coli, which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification."}

{"prompt":"Question: How quickly a population changes in size over time is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. population impact rate\nB. population multiplication rate\nC. population growth rate\nD. population direction rate","completion":"population growth rate\nExplanation: The population growth rate is how quickly a population changes in size over time. The rate of growth of a population may be positive or negative. A positive growth rate means that the population is increasing in size because more people are being added than lost. A negative growth rate means that the population is decreasing in size because more people are being lost than added."}
{"prompt":"Question: When zinc metal is mixed with sulfur and heated, what is produced?\nOptions:\n A. extraction sulfide\nB. zinc sulfide\nC. methane sulfide\nD. iron","completion":"zinc sulfide\nExplanation: In the course of a chemical reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, electrons are transferred from the metal atoms to the nonmetal atoms. For example, when zinc metal is mixed with sulfur and heated, the compound zinc sulfide is produced. Two valence electrons from each zinc atom are transferred to each sulfur atom."}
{"prompt":"Question: Conductive losses in the middle ear can be partially overcome by sending sound vibrations to what structure through the skull, the principle behind implants for hearing loss patients?\nOptions:\n A. cochlea\nB. tympanic membrane\nC. hammer and anvil\nD. cornea","completion":"cochlea\nExplanation: Hearing losses can occur because of problems in the middle or inner ear. Conductive losses in the middle ear can be partially overcome by sending sound vibrations to the cochlea through the skull. Hearing aids for this purpose usually press against the bone behind the ear, rather than simply amplifying the sound sent into the ear canal as many hearing aids do. Damage to the nerves in the cochlea is not repairable, but amplification can partially compensate. There is a risk that amplification will produce further damage. Another common failure in the cochlea is damage or loss of the cilia but with nerves remaining functional. Cochlear implants that stimulate the nerves directly are now available and widely accepted. Over 100,000 implants are in use, in about equal numbers of adults and children. The cochlear implant was pioneered in Melbourne, Australia, by Graeme Clark in the 1970s for his deaf father. The implant consists of three external components and two internal components. The external components are a microphone for picking up sound and converting it into an electrical signal, a speech processor to select certain frequencies and a transmitter to transfer the signal to the internal components through electromagnetic induction. The internal components consist of a receiver\/transmitter secured in the bone beneath the skin, which converts the signals into electric impulses and sends them through an internal cable."}

{"prompt":"Question: The nail bed is a specialized structure of the epidermis that is found at the tips of our what?\nOptions:\n A. fingers and toes\nB. fingers, nails, and scalp\nC. only nails\nD. only fingers","completion":"fingers and toes\nExplanation: Nails The nail bed is a specialized structure of the epidermis that is found at the tips of our fingers and toes. The nail body is formed on the nail bed, and protects the tips of our fingers and toes as they are the farthest extremities and the parts of the body that experience the maximum mechanical stress (Figure 5.13). In addition, the nail body forms a back-support for picking up small objects with the fingers. The nail body is composed of densely packed dead keratinocytes. The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form. The nail body forms at the nail root, which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables the nail to grow continuously. The lateral nail fold overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The nail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the nail cuticle, also called the eponychium. The nail bed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail matrix forms a crescent-shaped region called the lunula (the \u201clittle moon\u201d). The area beneath the free edge of the nail, furthest from the cuticle, is called the hyponychium. It consists of a thickened layer of stratum corneum."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which system is capable of responding quickly to changing situations?\nOptions:\n A. endocrine system\nB. nervous system\nC. reproductive system\nD. circulatory system","completion":"nervous system\nExplanation: In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling. The same hormone may play a role in a variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved. For example, the hormone oxytocin promotes uterine contractions in women in labor. It is also important in breastfeeding, and may be involved in the sexual response and in feelings of emotional attachment in both males and females. In general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the endocrine system is usually slower acting\u2014taking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining homeostasis, and controlling reproduction (Table 17.1). So how does the fight-or-flight response that was mentioned earlier happen so quickly if hormones are usually slower acting? It is because the two systems are connected. It is the fast action of the nervous system in response to the danger in the environment that stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete their hormones. As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses to keep up with sudden changes in both the external and internal environments when necessary."}
{"prompt":"Question: Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth are the three types of what cells and possess morphologies correlated with their functions?\nOptions:\n A. cartilage tissue\nB. muscle\nC. organ\nD. bone","completion":"muscle\nExplanation: 4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion The three types of muscle cells are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Their morphologies match their specific functions in the body. Skeletal muscle is voluntary and responds to conscious stimuli. The cells are striated and multinucleated appearing as long, unbranched cylinders. Cardiac muscle is involuntary and found only in the heart. Each cell is striated with a single nucleus and they attach to one another to form long fibers. Cells are attached to one another at intercalated disks. The cells are interconnected physically and electrochemically to act as a syncytium. Cardiac muscle cells contract autonomously and involuntarily. Smooth muscle is involuntary. Each cell is a spindle-shaped fiber and contains a single nucleus. No striations are evident because the actin and myosin filaments do not align in the cytoplasm."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why are living things considered to be renewable?\nOptions:\n A. they inherit traits\nB. they reproduce\nC. they evolve\nD. they decompose","completion":"they reproduce\nExplanation: Living things are considered to be renewable.

{"prompt":"Question: Which cell gives rise to all cells of the human body?\nOptions:\n A. totipotent stem cell\nB. signaler stem cell\nC. omnipoten stem cell\nD. schwann stem cell","completion":"totipotent stem cell\nExplanation: ability to diversify at each step. The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = \u201call\u201d) stem cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is the pluripotent stem cell, which gives rise to multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell. Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more specialized stem cells (Figure 18.4): \u2022 Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells quickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus. \u2022 Myeloid stem cells give rise to all the other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that produce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils."}

{"prompt":"Question: What measures a fluid\u2019s resistance to flow?\nOptions:\n A. elasticity\nB. density\nC. viscosity\nD. surface tension","completion":"viscosity\nExplanation: Viscosity measures a fluid\u2019s resistance to flow \u2013 the higher the viscosity, the slower the flow of the material. One factor that affects viscosity is the strength of the intermolecular forces in the material. Molecules that exhibit higher intermolecular forces tend to have higher viscosities. Temperature also influences viscosity. A higher temperature results in a decrease in viscosity, since molecules are moving faster and the intermolecular forces are more easily disrupted. Most cooking oils are more viscous than water, but when heated, the viscosity decreases and the oil spreads more easily. Motor oils are ranked by viscosity. Lower viscosity oils provide less drag on the engine, but they are also used up faster than a higher-viscosity material."}

{"prompt":"Question: What does the esophagus produce for lubrication?\nOptions:\n A. synovial fluid\nB. phloem\nC. bile\nD. mucous","completion":"mucous\nExplanation: animal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. How each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections. Carbohydrates The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into maltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of carbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme. The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or \u201ctable sugar\u201d) into glucose and fructose, and lactase breaks down lactose (or \u201cmilk sugar\u201d) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in Figure 34.16 and Table 34.5."}

{"prompt":"Question: An atom can be classified as a particular element based solely on its what?\nOptions:\n A. atomic number\nB. light number\nC. spectrum\nD. ability","completion":"atomic number\nExplanation: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of that element. An atom can be classified as a particular element based solely on its atomic number. For example, any atom with an atomic number of 8 (its nucleus contains 8 protons) is an oxygen atom, and any atom with a different number of protons would be a different element. The periodic table ( Figure below ) displays all of the known elements and is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. In this table, an element\u2019s atomic number is indicated above the elemental symbol. Hydrogen, at the upper left of the table, has an atomic number of 1. Every hydrogen atom has one proton in its nucleus. Next on the table is helium, whose atoms have two protons in the nucleus. Lithium atoms have three protons, beryllium atoms have four, and so on. Since atoms are neutral, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons. Therefore, hydrogen atoms all have one electron occupying the space outside of the nucleus."}

{"prompt":"Question: In which specific organs are hormonal cells located?\nOptions:\n A. mammary glands\nB. lymph nodes\nC. spinal cord\nD. endocrine glands","completion":"endocrine glands\nExplanation: Hormones Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. One mechanism of communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids, usually blood, which carries them to their target cells where they elicit a response. The cells that secrete hormones are often located in specific organs, called endocrine glands, and the cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of endocrine organs include the pancreas, which produces the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood-glucose levels, the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates. The endocrine glands differ from the exocrine glands. Exocrine glands secrete chemicals through ducts that lead outside the gland (not to the blood). For example, sweat produced by sweat glands is released into ducts that carry sweat to the surface of the skin. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions because besides releasing hormones into the blood. It also produces digestive juices, which are carried by ducts into the small intestine."}
{"prompt":"Question: What device is an electrochemical cell or series of cells that produces an electric current?\nOptions:\n A. battery\nB. reactor\nC. magnet\nD. generator","completion":"battery\nExplanation: A battery is an electrochemical cell or series of cells that produces an electric current. In principle, any galvanic cell could be used as a battery. An ideal battery would never run down, produce an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal characteristics and practical limitations. For example, the mass of a car battery is about 18 kg or about 1% of the mass of an average car or light-duty truck. This type of battery would supply nearly unlimited energy if used in a smartphone, but would be rejected for this application because of its mass. Thus, no single battery is \u201cbest\u201d and batteries are selected for a particular application, keeping things like the mass of the battery, its cost, reliability, and current capacity in mind. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. A few batteries of each type are described next."}

(d) Does this imply that space is \u201cmatter dominated\u201d? Explain briefly. (a) What Hubble constant corresponds to an approximate 10 age of the universe of 10 y? To get an approximate value, assume the expansion rate is constant and calculate the speed at which two galaxies must move apart to be separated by 1 Mly (present average galactic separation) in a time of 10 10 y. (b) Similarly, what Hubble constant corresponds to a 10 universe approximately 2\u00d710 -y old? 16. Show that the velocity of a star orbiting its galaxy in a circular orbit is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the mass of the stars inside its orbit acts like a single mass at the center of the galaxy. You may use an equation from a previous chapter to support your conclusion, but you must justify its use and define all terms used. The core of a star collapses during a supernova, forming a neutron star. Angular momentum of the core is conserved, and so the neutron star spins rapidly. If the initial core radius 5 is 5.0\u00d710 km and it collapses to 10.0 km, find the neutron star\u2019s angular velocity in revolutions per second, given the core\u2019s angular velocity was originally 1 revolution per 30.0 days.

{"prompt":"Question: Fishes were the earliest example of what subphylum, and jawless fishes were the earliest of these?\nOptions:\n A. grasses\nB. vertebrates\nC. ferns\nD. mammals","completion":"vertebrates\nExplanation: Fishes Modern fishes include an estimated 31,000 species. Fishes were the earliest vertebrates, and jawless fishes were the earliest of these. Jawless fishes\u2014the present day hagfishes and lampreys\u2014have a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes, distinguishing them from the invertebrate chordates. The jawed fishes evolved later and are extraordinarily diverse today. Fishes are active feeders, rather than sessile, suspension feeders. Jawless Fishes Jawless fishes are craniates (which includes all the chordate groups except the tunicates and lancelets) that represent an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over one half-billion years ago. Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the ostracoderms (which translates as \u201cshell-skin\u201d). Ostracoderms, now extinct, were vertebrate fishes encased in bony armor, unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. The clade Myxini includes 67 species of hagfishes. Hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates, other fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 15.37a). Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world except for the polar regions. A unique feature of these animals is the slime glands beneath the skin that are able to release an extraordinary amount of mucus through surface pores. This mucus may allow the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish are known to enter the bodies of dead or dying organisms to devour them from the inside."}

{"prompt":"Question: What function does the longer flagellae perform in dinoflagellates?\nOptions:\n A. propels\nB. defends\nC. grasps\nD. attacks","completion":"propels\nExplanation: 22.11.5 Pyrrophytes Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats composed of stiff cellulose. They are more easily identifiable, due to the presence of two flagellae. The longer flagellae propels the dinoflagellate, while the second shorter, flatter flagellae functions as a rudder. Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning the favour of sheltering them, dinoflagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water. A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoflagellates reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoflagellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife, and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife."}

{"prompt":"Question: On top of the otolithic membrane is a layer of calcium carbonate crystals, called what?\nOptions:\n A. cones\nB. gonads\nC. calcites\nD. otoliths","completion":"otoliths\nExplanation: Equilibrium (Balance) Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium, the sense of balance. A similar mechanoreceptor\u2014a hair cell with stereocilia\u2014senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the vestibule of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the utricle and saccule, whereas head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals. The neural signals generated in the vestibular ganglion are transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum. The utricle and saccule are both largely composed of macula tissue (plural = maculae). The macula is composed of hair cells surrounded by support cells. The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into a viscous gel called the otolithic membrane (Figure 14.11). On top of the otolithic membrane is a layer of calcium carbonate crystals, called otoliths. The otoliths essentially make the otolithic membrane top-heavy. The otolithic membrane moves separately from the macula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes the otolithic membrane to slide over the macula in the direction of gravity. The moving otolithic membrane, in turn, bends the sterocilia, causing some hair cells to depolarize as others hyperpolarize. The exact position of the head is interpreted by the brain based on the pattern of hair-cell depolarization."}
{"prompt":"Question: Diabetes is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to control the amount of what in the blood?\nOptions:\n A. water\nB. plasma\nC. sugar\nD. protein","completion":"sugar\nExplanation: Diabetes is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have high blood sugar, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin, or because their cells do not respond to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells take up sugar from the blood. Without enough insulin, the blood contains too much sugar. This can damage blood vessels and other cells throughout the body. The kidneys work hard to filter out and remove some of the extra sugar. This leads to frequent urination and excessive thirst."}

{"prompt":"Question: After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its what, protein synthesis can take place?\nOptions:\n A. base\nB. RNA receptor\nC. trna carrier\nD. dna molecule","completion":"trna carrier\nExplanation: How can a molecule containing just 4 different nucleotides specify the sequence of the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins? If each nucleotide coded for 1 amino acid, then obviously the nucleic acids could code for only 4 amino acids. What if amino acids were coded for by groups of 2 nucleotides? There are 42, or 16, different combinations of 2 nucleotides (AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, and so on). Such a code is more extensive but still not adequate to code for 20 amino acids. However, if the nucleotides are arranged in groups of 3, the number of different possible combinations is 43, or 64. Here we have a code that is extensive enough to direct the synthesis of the primary structure of a protein molecule. The genetic code can therefore be described as the identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid. The sequence of these triplet groups in the mRNA dictates the sequence of the amino acids in the protein. Each individual three-nucleotide coding unit, as we have seen, is called a codon. Protein synthesis is accomplished by orderly interactions between mRNA and the other ribonucleic acids (transfer RNA [tRNA] and ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), the ribosome, and more than 100 enzymes. The mRNA formed in the nucleus during transcription is transported across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes\u2014carrying with it the genetic instructions. The process in which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids and thus ultimately to synthesize a protein is referred to as translation. Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, it must be attached to its unique tRNA. This crucial process requires an enzyme known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Figure 19.12 \"Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA\"). There is a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. This high degree of specificity is vital to the incorporation of the correct amino acid into a protein. After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its tRNA carrier, protein synthesis can take place. Figure 19.13 \"The Elongation Steps in Protein Synthesis\" depicts a schematic stepwise representation of this all-important process.

{"prompt":"Question: When waves are reflected at the same angle, what is it called?\nOptions:\n A. field of view\nB. refraction\nC. angle of reflection\nD. phenomenon of reflection","completion":"angle of reflection\nExplanation: Reflected waves have the same speed and frequency as the original waves before they were reflected. However, the direction of the reflected waves is different. When waves strike an obstacle head on, the reflected waves bounce straight back in the direction they came from. When waves strike an obstacle at any other angle, they bounce back at the same angle but in a different direction. This is illustrated in the Figure below . In this diagram, waves strike a wall at an angle, called the angle of incidence. The waves are reflected at the same angle, called the angle of reflection, but in a different direction. Notice that both angles are measured relative to a line that is perpendicular to the wall."}

{"prompt":"Question: Like sharks, nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental stage is made of what connective tissue?\nOptions:\n A. cartilage\nB. chloroplasm\nC. phloem\nD. collagen","completion":"cartilage\nExplanation: Cartilage Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers. The cells, called chondrocytes, make the matrix and fibers of the tissue. Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae. A cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in Figure 33.14. The lacunae are randomly scattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains. Sharks have cartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental stage. A remnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose. Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends of long bones, reducing friction and cushioning the articulations of these bones."}
{"prompt":"Question: Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more what?\nOptions:\n A. active\nB. inactive\nC. dense\nD. abundant","completion":"active\nExplanation: The density of air varies from place to place.

The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude."}
{"prompt":"Question: What color light is actually the absence of electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum, for humans?\nOptions:\n A. ultraviolet light\nB. black light\nC. infrared light\nD. blue light","completion":"black light\nExplanation: The visible range of light (i. e. the range of wavelengths that our eyes can detect) is a very narrow piece of the full EM spectrum. In the visible range our eyes differentiate between the different wavelengths by producing \u2018color\u2019 for them. When we observe something that is green, it is green to us, because the wavelength of the light hitting our eyes is around 550 nm. If the wavelength of light is slightly larger than this it starts to look red, if it is slightly smaller it looks blue. White light is the combination of all the colors. Black light is the absence of EM waves in the visible spectrum for human beings."}

{"prompt":"Question: Professionals known as genetic counselors can help them understand the risks of?\nOptions:\n A. contagion\nB. infection\nC. children being affected\nD. disease","completion":"children being affected\nExplanation: A genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation can be inherited. Therefore, people with a genetic disorder in their family may be concerned about having children with the disorder. Professionals known as genetic counselors can help them understand the risks of their children being affected. If they decide to have children, they may be advised to have prenatal (\u201cbefore birth\u201d) testing to see if the fetus has any genetic abnormalities. One method of prenatal testing is amniocentesis. In this procedure, a few fetal cells are extracted from the fluid surrounding the fetus, and the fetal chromosomes are examined."}

No, of course not. Is it possible to get lung cancer without smoking? Sadly, yes it is. That's not to say there is no relationship between the two: smoking is still the leading cause of lung cancer. But it does suggest that a person's genetic background has a role in this process. Apart form true single gene disorders, environmental factors, or environmental triggers , may determine the development of disease in individuals genetically predisposed to a particular condition. Environmental triggers may include stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Many cancers are thought to have an environmental component.

{"prompt":"Question: What type of orbitals do electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill first?\nOptions:\n A. orbital lobes\nB. low-energy\nC. outer orbitals\nD. high energy","completion":"low-energy\nExplanation: Electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the 5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of l increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order s > p > d > f. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron\u2013nucleus attractions slightly (recall that all electrons have \u22121 charges, but nuclei have +Z charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1s through 3p), the increase in energy due to n is more significant than the increase due to l; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order. The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 6.26): 1. The number of the principal quantum shell, n, 2. The letter that designates the orbital type (the subshell, l), and 3. A superscript number that designates the number of electrons in that particular subshell."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission called?\nOptions:\n A. concentrated mass\nB. critical mass\nC. baseline mass\nD. particular mass","completion":"critical mass\nExplanation: U92235 + n01\u00ae B56141a + K3692r + 3n01 This hypothesis was confirmed by detecting the krypton-92 fission product. As discussed in Section 20.2 \"Nuclear Reactions\", the nucleus usually divides asymmetrically rather than into two equal parts, and the fission of a given nuclide does not give the same products every time. In a typical nuclear fission reaction, more than one neutron is released by each dividing nucleus. When these neutrons collide with and induce fission in other neighboring nuclei, a self-sustaining series of nuclear fission reactions known as anuclear chain reaction can result (Figure 20.16 \"The Curve of Nuclear Binding Energy\"). For example, the fission of 235U releases two to three neutrons per fission event. If absorbed by other 235U nuclei, those neutrons induce additional fission events, and the rate of the fission reaction increases geometrically. Each series of events is called a generation. Experimentally, it is found that some minimum mass of a fissile isotope is required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction; if the mass is too low, too many neutrons are able to escape without being captured and inducing a fission reaction. The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the critical mass. This amount depends on the purity of the material and the shape of the mass, which corresponds to the amount of surface area available from which neutrons can escape, and on the identity of the isotope. If the mass of the fissile isotope is greater than the critical mass, then under the right conditions, the resulting supercritical mass can release energy explosively. The enormous energy released from nuclear chain reactions is responsible for the massive destruction caused by the detonation of nuclear weapons such as fission bombs, but it also forms the basis of the nuclear power industry. Nuclear fusion, in which two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier, more stable nucleus, is the opposite of nuclear fission. As in the nuclear transmutation reactions discussed in Section 20.2 \"Nuclear."}
{"prompt":"Question: Surface tension forces between moleculse cause the surface of liquid to contract to what?\nOptions:\n A. typically surface area\nB. Weak Surface area\nC. strongest surface area\nD. smallest surface area","completion":"smallest surface area\nExplanation: Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces, reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all sides. Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Making Connections: Surface Tension Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon. The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline\u2014they dent the surface as shown in Figure 11.28(a). Figure 11.28(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would sink."}

{"prompt":"Question: What diagram is used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms?\nOptions:\n A. relationships tree\nB. phylogenetic tree\nC. conceptual tree\nD. biodiversity tree","completion":"phylogenetic tree\nExplanation: Classification and Phylogeny Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and relationships between organisms. A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. The hierarchical classification of groups nested within more inclusive groups is reflected in diagrams. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past because one cannot go back through time to confirm the proposed relationships. Unlike with a taxonomic classification, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history, as shown in Figure 12.4. Shared characteristics are used to construct phylogenetic trees. The point where a split occurs in a tree, called a branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into distinct new ones. Many phylogenetic trees have a single branch point at the base representing a common ancestor of all the branches in the tree. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral taxon at the base of a phylogenetic tree to which all organisms represented in the diagram descend from. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called sister taxa, for example the two species of orangutans. A branch point with more than two groups illustrates a situation for which scientists have not definitively determined relationships. An example is illustrated by the three branches leading to the gorilla subspecies; their exact relationships are not yet understood. It is important to note that sister taxa share an ancestor, which does not mean that one taxon evolved from the other. The branch point, or split, represents a common ancestor that existed in the past, but that no longer exists. Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees (nor did chimpanzees evolve from humans) although they are our closest living relatives. Both humans and chimpanzees evolved from a common ancestor that lived, scientists believe, six million years ago and looked different from both modern chimpanzees and modern humans."}

{"prompt":"Question: The wrist and base of the hand are formed by what series of small bones arranged in distal and proximal rows?\nOptions:\n A. carpal\nB. ribs\nC. patella\nD. cranial","completion":"carpal\nExplanation: Carpal Bones The wrist and base of the hand are formed by a series of eight small carpal bones (see Figure 8.7). The carpal bones are arranged in two rows, forming a proximal row of four carpal bones and a distal row of four carpal bones. The bones in the proximal row, running from the lateral (thumb) side to the medial side, are the scaphoid (\u201cboat-shaped\u201d), lunate (\u201cmoonshaped\u201d), triquetrum (\u201cthree-cornered\u201d), and pisiform (\u201cpea-shaped\u201d) bones. The small, rounded pisiform bone articulates with the anterior surface of the triquetrum bone. The pisiform thus projects anteriorly, where it forms the bony bump that can be felt at the medial base of your hand. The distal bones (lateral to medial) are the trapezium (\u201ctable\u201d), trapezoid (\u201cresembles a table\u201d), capitate (\u201chead-shaped\u201d), and hamate (\u201chooked bone\u201d) bones. The hamate bone is characterized by a prominent bony extension on its anterior side called the hook of the hamate bone. A helpful mnemonic for remembering the arrangement of the carpal bones is \u201cSo Long To Pinky, Here Comes The Thumb. \u201d This mnemonic starts on the lateral side and names the proximal bones from lateral to medial (scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform), then makes a U-turn to name the distal bones from medial to lateral (hamate, capitate, trapezoid, trapezium). Thus, it starts and finishes on the lateral side."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less what?\nOptions:\n A. insoluble\nB. abundant\nC. soluble\nD. saturated","completion":"soluble\nExplanation: Introduction Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine species. They are being threatened by climate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the composition of the solution we know as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to affect our oceans. Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical reactions. In this chapter, we will consider the nature of solutions, and examine factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it may have. In addition, we will discuss colloids\u2014systems that resemble solutions but consist of dispersions of particles somewhat larger than ordinary molecules or ions."}

{"prompt":"Question: Unevenness or asymmetry in the focus of the eye describes what visual defect?\nOptions:\n A. presbyopia\nB. hyperopia\nC. myopia\nD. astigmatism","completion":"astigmatism\nExplanation: Another common vision defect is astigmatism, an unevenness or asymmetry in the focus of the eye. For example, rays passing through a vertical region of the eye may focus closer than rays passing through a horizontal region, resulting in the image appearing elongated. This is mostly due to irregularities in the shape of the cornea but can also be due to lens irregularities or unevenness in the retina. Because of these irregularities, different parts of the lens system produce images at different locations. The eye-brain system can compensate for some of these irregularities, but they generally manifest themselves as less distinct vision or sharper images along certain axes. Figure 26.8 shows a chart used to detect astigmatism. Astigmatism can be at least partially corrected with a spectacle having the opposite irregularity of the eye. If an eyeglass prescription has a cylindrical correction, it is there to correct astigmatism. The normal corrections for short- or farsightedness are spherical corrections, uniform along all axes."}

Since any two species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete the other. One species will be better adapted to its environment, and essentially \"win\" the competition. The other species will have lower reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower survival rate. For example, cheetahs and lions feed on similar prey. If prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population."}

{"prompt":"Question: The ability to regulate what, which is possessed by mammals, was an advantage as earth\u2019s climate went through sudden and dramatic changes?\nOptions:\n A. mutations\nB. reflex behaviors\nC. body temperature\nD. hair growth","completion":"body temperature\nExplanation: Mammals have the ability to regulate body temperature. This is an advantage, as Earth\u2019s climate went through sudden and dramatic changes. Mastodons, saber tooth tigers, hoofed mammals, whales, primates and eventually humans all lived during the Cenozoic Era ( Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of energy travels through matter in wave form?\nOptions:\n A. sound\nB. vibrational\nC. magnetic\nD. light","completion":"sound\nExplanation: Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound is called hearing . The organ that we use to sense sound energy is the ear. Almost all the structures in the ear are needed for this purpose. Together, they gather sound waves, amplify the waves, and change their kinetic energy to electrical signals. The electrical signals travel to the brain, which interprets them as the sounds we hear."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a species that plays an especially important role in it's community called?\nOptions:\n A. complement\nB. Invasive\nC. keystone\nD. Leader","completion":"keystone\nExplanation: Some predator species are known as keystone species. A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed."}
{"prompt":"Question: How did a vascular let plants grow?\nOptions:\n A. they could conduct photosynthesis\nB. they could bear fruit\nC. they could reproduce\nD. they could grow taller","completion":"they could grow taller\nExplanation: The evolution of vascular tissue revolutionized the plant kingdom. Vascular tissue greatly improved the ability of plants to absorb and transfer water. This allowed plants to grow larger and taller. They could also liver in drier habitats and survive periods of drought. Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern in Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which chromosome is associated with cri du chat syndrome?\nOptions:\n A. collagen 5\nB. genome 5\nC. chromosome 5\nD. spore 5","completion":"chromosome 5\nExplanation: Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged. For example, if a tiny portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the individual will have cri du chat (cat\u2019s cry) syndrome. These individuals have misshapen facial features, and the infant\u2019s cry resembles a cat\u2019s cry."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is algae easier to covert into that corn is currently used for?\nOptions:\n A. oil\nB. food\nC. sugar\nD. fuel","completion":"fuel\nExplanation: Research is being done into alternative crops for biofuels. A very promising alternative is algae. Algae appears to be a better biofuel than corn. Algae is much easier to convert to a usable fuel. Growing algae requires much less land and energy than crops. Algae can be grown in locations that are not used for other things. For example, they can be grown in desert areas where food crops are not often grown. Corn must be grown where food crops are grown. This can reduce the land and water available for growing food. Algae can be fed agricultural and other waste, so valuable resources are not used. Much research is being done to bring these alternative fuels to market."}
{"prompt":"Question: The actinides are all what type of elements?\nOptions:\n A. large\nB. nuclear\nC. radioactive\nD. multiple","completion":"radioactive\nExplanation: actinide: The actinides are the 14 elements from thorium (atomic number 90) to lawrencium (atomic number 103).

They include crocodiles, alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles. The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. It consists of all amniotes except birds and mammals."}
{"prompt":"Question: What elements do mafic minerals typically include?\nOptions:\n A. iodine and magnesium\nB. sodium and magnesium\nC. iron and magnesium\nD. xerophyte and magnesium","completion":"iron and magnesium\nExplanation: First, notice where carbon is fixed by the enzyme Rubisco. In C-3, C-4, and CAM plants, CO 2 enters the cycle by joining with 5-carbon ribulose bisphosphate to form a 6-carbon intermediate, which splits (so quickly that it isn\u2019t even shown) into two 3-carbon 3-phosphoglycerate molecules. Now look for the points at which ATP and NADPH (made in the light reactions) add chemical energy (\u201cReduction\u201d in the diagram) to the 3-carbon molecules. The resulting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate \u201chalf-sugars\u201d can enter several different metabolic pathways. One recreates the original 5-carbon precursor, completing the cycle. A second combines two of the 3-carbon molecules to form glucose, the universal fuel for life. The cycle begins and ends with the same 5-carbon RuBP molecule, but the process combines carbon and energy to build carbohydrates \u2013 food for life."}
{"prompt":"Question: As per the kinetic-molecular theory, in what direction do the molecules and ions of liquids move?\nOptions:\n A. alter directions\nB. random directions\nC. opposite direction\nD. same direction","completion":"random directions\nExplanation: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature \u2013 the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed."}
{"prompt":"Question: Birds generally practice what kind of relationship, with both parents helping to care for the young?\nOptions:\n A. monogamous\nB. carnivorous\nC. synonomous\nD. homologous","completion":"monogamous\nExplanation: Birds generally are monogamous, and both parents help to care for the young."}

{"prompt":"Question: Sounds, chemicals, and visual cues are examples of what between animals?\nOptions:\n A. migration\nB. circulation\nC. procreation\nD. communication","completion":"communication\nExplanation: For individuals to cooperate, they need to communicate . Animals can communicate with sounds, chemicals, or visual cues. For example, to communicate with sounds, birds sing and frogs croak. Both may be communicating that they are good mates. Ants communicate with chemicals called pheromones . For example, they use the chemicals to mark trails to food sources so other ants can find them. Male dogs use pheromones in urine to mark their territory. They are \u201ctelling\u201d other dogs to stay out of their yard. You can see several examples of visual communication in Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat?\nOptions:\n A. family\nB. ecosystem\nC. population\nD. biosphere","completion":"population\nExplanation: CHAPTER SUMMARY 45.1 Population Demography Populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat. Ecologists measure characteristics of populations: size, density, dispersion pattern, age structure, and sex ratio. Life tables are useful to calculate life expectancies of individual population members. Survivorship curves show the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of eukaryotes are protists normally?\nOptions:\n A. multicellular\nB. photosynthetic\nC. unicellular\nD. immature","completion":"unicellular\nExplanation: Most protists are so small that they can be seen only with a microscope. Protists are mostly unicellular (one-celled) eukaryotes. A few protists are multicellular (many-celled) and surprisingly large. For example, kelp is a multicellular protist that can grow to be over 100-meters long ( Figure below ). Multicellular protists, however, do not show cellular specialization or differentiation into tissues. That means their cells all look the same and, for the most part, function the same. On the other hand, your cells often are much different from each other and have special jobs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the loss of one or more electrons by an atom?\nOptions:\n A. half-life\nB. decomposition\nC. oxidation\nD. evaporation","completion":"oxidation\nExplanation: The reactants are two electrically neutral elements; they have the same number of electrons as protons. The product, however, is ionic; it is composed of Mg2+ and Cl\u2212ions. Somehow, the individual Mg atoms lose two electrons to make the Mg2+ ion, while the Cl atoms gain an electron to become Cl\u2212 ions. This reaction involves thetransfer of electrons between atoms. The process of losing and gaining electrons occurs simultaneously. However, mentally we can separate the two processes. Oxidation is defined as the loss of one or more electrons by an atom. Reduction is defined as the gain of one or more electrons by an atom. So oxidation and reduction always occur together; it is only mentally that we can separate them. Chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons are called oxidation-reduction (or redox) reactions. Redox reactions require that we keep track of the electrons assigned to each atom in a chemical reaction. How do we do that? We use oxidation numbers to keep track of electrons in atoms. Oxidation numbers are assigned to atoms based on four rules. Oxidation numbers are not necessarily equal to the charge on the atom (although sometimes they can be); we must keep the concepts of charge and oxidation numbers separate. The rules for assigning oxidation numbers to atoms are as follows: 1."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is the root cap continuously replaced in plants?\nOptions:\n A. due to growth\nB. damage through pushing\nC. due to pressure\nD. due to rubbing","completion":"damage through pushing\nExplanation: Root Growth and Anatomy Root growth begins with seed germination. When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms the root system. The tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure. The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. The root tip can be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation (Figure 30.16). The zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem. The zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root. Beginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types. All three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip."}

In the process, a water molecule is lost. By convention, the carbon atoms in a monosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to the carbonyl group. In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage is formed between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose."}
{"prompt":"Question: An electrical motor changes electrical energy into what?\nOptions:\n A. chemical energy\nB. mechanical energy\nC. solar energy\nD. thermal energy","completion":"mechanical energy\nExplanation: Electrical motors change electrical energy into mechanical energy. The motor consists of an electrical circuit with part of the wires inside a magnetic field. This can be seen below. Positive charges move through the circuit in the direction of the light purple arrows. When the charges move up through the part of the coil that is right next to the north pole, the right hand rule tells us that the wire suffers the force, F , pushing the wire in the direction of the blue arrow, toward the back of the sketch. On the other side of the coil, where the charges are moving down through the field, the right hand rule shows the force would push this side of the coil toward the front. These two forces are working together, rotating the coil in the direction of the circular red arrow."}
{"prompt":"Question: Evolution that occurs over a short period of time is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. short term evolution\nB. microevolution\nC. pseudoevolution\nD. relatedness","completion":"microevolution\nExplanation: Evolution that occurs over a short period of time is known as microevolution . It might take place in just a couple of generations. This scale of evolution occurs at the level of the population. The Grants observed evolution at this scale in populations of Darwin\u2019s finches. Beak size in finch populations changed in just two years because of a serious drought."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain called?\nOptions:\n A. corpus callosum\nB. cerebral cortex\nC. spinal cord\nD. cranial septum","completion":"corpus callosum\nExplanation: Left Brain, Right Brain Popular media often refer to right-brained and left-brained people, as if the brain were two independent halves that work differently for different people. This is a popular misinterpretation of an important neurological phenomenon. As an extreme measure to deal with a debilitating condition, the corpus callosum may be sectioned to overcome intractable epilepsy. When the connections between the two cerebral hemispheres are cut, interesting effects can be observed. If a person with an intact corpus callosum is asked to put their hands in their pockets and describe what is there on the basis of what their hands feel, they might say that they have keys in their right pocket and loose change in the left. They may even be able to count the coins in their pocket and say if they can afford to buy a candy bar from the vending machine. If a person with a sectioned corpus callosum is given the same instructions, they will do something quite peculiar. They will only put their right hand in their pocket and say they have keys there. They will not even move their left hand, much less report that there is loose change in the left pocket. The reason for this is that the language functions of the cerebral cortex are localized to the left hemisphere in 95 percent of the population. Additionally, the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body through the corticospinal tract and the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. Motor commands from the precentral gyrus control the opposite side of the body, whereas sensory information processed by the postcentral gyrus is received from the opposite side of the body. For a verbal command to initiate movement of the right arm and hand, the left side of the brain needs to be connected by the corpus callosum. Language is processed in the left side of the brain and directly influences the left brain and right arm motor functions, but is sent to influence the right brain and left arm motor functions through the corpus callosum. Likewise, the left-handed sensory perception of what is in the left pocket travels across the corpus callosum from the right brain, so no verbal report on those contents would be possible if the hand happened to be in the pocket."}
{"prompt":"Question: In what energy industry process are fluids pumped through a borehole, creating fractures in the rock that contains the natural gas?\nOptions:\n A. grinding\nB. oil wells\nC. fracking\nD. strip mining","completion":"fracking\nExplanation: With fracking, fluids are pumped through a borehole.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a combination of substances in which there is no chemical reaction?\nOptions:\n A. a combination\nB. a mixture\nC. a solute\nD. a solution","completion":"a mixture\nExplanation: Like a chemical compound, a mixture consists of more than one chemical substance. Unlike a compound, a mixture does not have a fixed chemical composition. The substances in a mixture can be combined in any proportions. A mixture also does not involve a chemical reaction. Therefore, the substances in a mixture are not changed into unique new substances, and they can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction."}

{"prompt":"Question: Hypoxia is a condition of the reduced supply of what?\nOptions:\n A. methane\nB. food\nC. oxygen\nD. nitrogen","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Figure 10.14 The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen (hypoxia is a condition of reduced oxygen supply). If damage is detected, p53 triggers repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53 signals apoptosis. A cell with an abnormal p53 protein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis. Cells with abnormal p53 can become cancerous. (credit: modification of work by Thierry Soussi)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Genetic equilibrium occurs when what process doesn't exist within the population?\nOptions:\n A. evolution\nB. movement\nC. reproduction\nD. variation","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: The Hardy-Weinberg model describes how a population can remain at genetic equilibrium , referred to as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic equilibrium occurs when there is no evolution within the population. In other words, the frequency of alleles (variants of a gene) will be the same from one generation to another. At genetic equilibrium, the gene or allele frequencies are stable \u2014 they do not change. For example, let's assume that red hair is determined by the inheritance of a gene with two alleles\u2014 R and r . The dominant allele, R , encodes for non-red hair, while the recessive allele, r , encodes for red hair. If a population's gene pool contains 90% R and 10% r alleles, then the next generation would also have 90% R and 10% r alleles. However, this only works under a strict set of conditions."}
{"prompt":"Question: Plants need sunlight for what process?\nOptions:\n A. photosynthesis\nB. metamorphosis\nC. cyclogenesis\nD. glycolysis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: The water in a large lake may be so deep that sunlight cannot penetrate all the way to the bottom. Without sunlight, water plants and algae cannot live on the bottom of the lake. That\u2019s because plants need sunlight for photosynthesis."}

{"prompt":"Question: What carry messages from our sensory organs and others to the central nervous system?\nOptions:\n A. fibers\nB. nerves\nC. valves\nD. blood vessels","completion":"nerves\nExplanation: 20.7 Nerve Conduction\u2013Electrocardiograms Nerve Conduction Electric currents in the vastly complex system of billions of nerves in our body allow us to sense the world, control parts of our body, and think. These are representative of the three major functions of nerves. First, nerves carry messages from our sensory organs and others to the central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal cord. Second, nerves carry messages from the central nervous system to muscles and other organs. Third, nerves transmit and process signals within the central nervous system. The sheer number of nerve cells and the incredibly greater number of connections between them makes this system the subtle wonder that it is. Nerve conduction is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells. It is one aspect of bioelectricity, or electrical effects in and created by biological systems. Nerve cells, properly called neurons, look different from other cells\u2014they have tendrils, some of them many centimeters long, connecting them with other cells. (See Figure 20.27. ) Signals arrive at the cell body across synapses or through dendrites, stimulating the neuron to generate its own signal, sent along its long axon to other nerve or muscle cells. Signals may arrive from many other locations and be transmitted to yet others, conditioning the synapses by use, giving the system its complexity and its ability to learn."}

Einstein argued that when an electron returns to a lower energy level and gives off electromagnetic energy, the energy is released as a discrete \u201cpacket\u201d of energy. We now call such a packet of energy a photon . According to Einstein, a photon resembles a particle but moves like a wave. You can see this in the Figure below . The theory posits that waves of photons traveling through space or matter make up electromagnetic radiation."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term describes the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area?\nOptions:\n A. hemosphere\nB. wind patterns\nC. solar activity\nD. climate","completion":"climate\nExplanation: Climate and Weather A common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for example, a very cool week in June in central Indiana) is evidence of global climate change. However, a cold week in June is a weather-related event and not a climate-related one. These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms climate and weather. Climate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area. The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast, weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles. Long-range weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable. To better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern Wisconsin. You would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you have long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an outdoor event in Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January. However, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held on because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. Climate can be considered \u201caverage\u201d weather."}

{"prompt":"Question: A multiaxial ball-and-socket joint has much more mobility than a what hinge joint?\nOptions:\n A. triaxial\nB. biaxial\nC. uniaxial\nD. quadaxial","completion":"uniaxial\nExplanation: 9.6 | Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe the bones that articulate together to form selected synovial joints \u2022 Discuss the movements available at each joint \u2022 Describe the structures that support and prevent excess movements at each joint Each synovial joint of the body is specialized to perform certain movements. The movements that are allowed are determined by the structural classification for each joint. For example, a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint has much more mobility than a uniaxial hinge joint. However, the ligaments and muscles that support a joint may place restrictions on the total range of motion available. Thus, the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder has little in the way of ligament support, which gives the shoulder a very large range of motion. In contrast, movements at the hip joint are restricted by strong ligaments, which reduce its range of motion but confer stability during standing and weight bearing. This section will examine the anatomy of selected synovial joints of the body. Anatomical names for most joints are derived from the names of the bones that articulate at that joint, although some joints, such as the elbow, hip, and knee joints are exceptions to this general naming scheme."}

{"prompt":"Question: What process refers to the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia?\nOptions:\n A. biological nutrient fixation\nB. biological ammonia fixation\nC. biological nitrogen fixation\nD. biological respiratory fixation","completion":"biological nitrogen fixation\nExplanation: 31.3 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants Atmospheric nitrogen is the largest pool of available nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, plants cannot use this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. The most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legumes. The bacteria form nodules on the legume\u2019s roots in which nitrogen fixation takes place. Fungi form symbiotic associations (mycorrhizae) with plants, becoming integrated into the physical structure of the root. Through mycorrhization, the plant obtains minerals from the soil and the fungus obtains photosynthate from the plant root. Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the root, while endomycorrhizae are embedded within the root tissue. Some plants\u2014parasites, saprophytes, symbionts, epiphytes, and insectivores\u2014have evolved adaptations to obtain their organic or mineral nutrition from various sources."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the common term for erythrocytesare, specialized cells that circulate delivering oxygen to cells and are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow?\nOptions:\n A. plateletes\nB. white blood cells\nC. monocytes\nD. red blood cells","completion":"red blood cells\nExplanation: Red Blood Cells Red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = \u201cred\u201d; -cyte = \u201ccell\u201d), are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. In mammals, red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7\u20138 \u00b5m in size. In birds and nonavian reptiles, a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells. The red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in Figure 40.6a. The principal job of this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 \u00d7 1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at any time. In mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack of mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells, and some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells. The advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that these cells can undergo mitosis. Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport. Not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood use different pigments to bind to the oxygen. These pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen. Invertebrates have a variety of other respiratory pigments. Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in Figure 40.6b is found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods. Chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is found in four families of polychaete tubeworms. Hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete worms and annelids and is illustrated in Figure 40.6c. Despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and its oxygen-carrying capacity is poor compared to hemoglobin."}

{"prompt":"Question: What connects the two hemispheres of the brain?\nOptions:\n A. corpus callosum\nB. The brain stem\nC. holy callosum\nD. disruption callosum","completion":"corpus callosum\nExplanation: The Brain The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (corpus = \u201cbody\u201d; callosum = \u201ctough\u201d) connects the two hemispheres. Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems. In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an."}

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant\u2019s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil."}
{"prompt":"Question: In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy powering any type of matter in motion, while the energy of position is called what?\nOptions:\n A. mechanical energy\nB. potential energy\nC. magnetic energy\nD. thermal energy","completion":"potential energy\nExplanation: The Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions Chemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and force that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy powering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one brick atop another is kinetic energy\u2014the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it stores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the positioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as kinetic energy as the bricks fall. In the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the form of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical energy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is neither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before heading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged by your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy. Chemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the foods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules your body uses."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the resistance of a liquid to flow called?\nOptions:\n A. viscosity\nB. turbulence\nC. permeability\nD. elasticity","completion":"viscosity\nExplanation: Viscosity (\u03b7) is the resistance of a liquid to flow. Some liquids, such as gasoline, ethanol, and water, flow very readily and hence have a low viscosity. Others, such as motor oil, molasses, and maple syrup, flow very slowly and have a high viscosity. The two most common methods for evaluating the viscosity of a liquid are (1) to measure the time it takes for a quantity of liquid to flow through a narrow vertical tube and (2) to measure the time it takes steel balls to fall through a given volume of the liquid. The higher the viscosity, the slower the liquid flows through the tube and the steel balls fall. Viscosity is expressed in units of the poise (mPa\u00b7s); the higher the number, the higher the viscosity. The viscosities of some representative liquids are listed in Table 11.4 \"Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25\u00b0C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids\" and show a correlation between viscosity and intermolecular forces. Because a liquid can flow only if the molecules can move past one another with minimal resistance, strong intermolecular attractive forces make it more difficult for molecules to move with respect to one another. The addition of a second hydroxyl group to ethanol, for example, which produces ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH), increases the viscosity 15-fold. This effect is due to the increased number of hydrogen bonds that can form between hydroxyl groups in adjacent molecules, resulting in dramatically stronger intermolecular attractive forces."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the chemical formula for a glucose molecule?\nOptions:\n A. a5 h12 o6\nB. H2 C3 NA6\nC. c6 h12 o6\nD. d5 h12 o6","completion":"c6 h12 o6\nExplanation: The sugar glucose is a covalent compound. When sugar dissolves in water, it forms individual glucose molecules (C 6 H 12 O 6 ). You can see how this happens in the Figure below . Sugar is polar like water, so sugar molecules also have positive and negative ends. Forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of water and sugar molecules pull individual sugar molecules away from the sugar crystal. Little by little, the sugar molecules are separated from the crystal and surrounded by water. You can watch this happening in the video at the following URL: http:\/\/www. youtube. com\/watch?v=hydUVGUbyvU."}
{"prompt":"Question: Root systems are mainly of two types. dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a what?\nOptions:\n A. long root system\nB. runner root system\nC. fibrous root system\nD. attaching root system","completion":"fibrous root system\nExplanation: Types of Root Systems Root systems are mainly of two types (Figure 30.15). Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system. A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise. Dandelions are a good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root). A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. In contrast, a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat, rice, and corn). Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems."}

{"prompt":"Question: Viroids are plant pathogens much simpler than what, but like them can reproduce only within a host cell?\nOptions:\n A. pests\nB. bacteria\nC. parasites\nD. viruses","completion":"viruses\nExplanation: Viroids Viroids are plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus. They do not have a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. Viroids do not, however, manufacture any proteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule. Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified. Viroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.18) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in agricultural revenue each year. Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums, avocados, and coconut palms."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the ideal mechanical advantage in the single fixed pulley?\nOptions:\n A. 1\nB. zero\nC. 2\nD. 4","completion":"1\nExplanation: In the single fixed pulley, only one rope segment pulls up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. In other words, this type of pulley doesn\u2019t increase the force that is applied to it. However, it does change the direction of the force. This allows you to use your weight to pull on one end of the rope and more easily raise the load attached to the other end."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the process of isolating a specific gene and then making a copy of it for use in gene therapy?\nOptions:\n A. attribute cloning\nB. gene treatment\nC. gene cloning\nD. gene copying","completion":"gene cloning\nExplanation: Gene cloning is the process of isolating and making copies of a gene.

{"prompt":"Question: What type of reproduction produces offspring from a single parent that share the exact same genetic material as the parent?\nOptions:\n A. mutation\nB. asexual reproduction\nC. microscopic reproduction\nD. sexual reproduction","completion":"asexual reproduction\nExplanation: When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring (\"children\") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single-celled organism, must reproduce asexually."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle?\nOptions:\n A. circadian rhythms\nB. cognitive rhythms\nC. variable rhythms\nD. sleep rhythms","completion":"circadian rhythms\nExplanation: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"Question: What happens when alkanes are mixed with oxygen at room temperature?\nOptions:\n A. single replacement\nB. no reaction\nC. redox\nD. combustion","completion":"no reaction\nExplanation: Neither positive ions nor negative ions are attracted to a nonpolar molecule. In fact, the alkanes undergo so few reactions that they are sometimes called paraffins, from the Latin parum affinis, meaning \u201clittle affinity. \u201d Two important reactions that the alkanes do undergo are combustion and halogenation. Nothing happens when alkanes are merely mixed with oxygen (O2) at room temperature, but when a flame or spark provides the activation energy, a highly exothermic combustion reaction proceeds vigorously.

{"prompt":"Question: Liquefaction ccurs when the molecules of a gas are cooled to the point where they no longer possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome what?\nOptions:\n A. intermolecular gravitational forces\nB. intermolecular attractive forces\nC. gravitational attractive forces\nD. bonding attractive forces","completion":"intermolecular attractive forces\nExplanation: Liquefaction of Gases Liquefaction of gases is the condensation of gases into a liquid form, which is neither anticipated nor explained by the kinetic molecular theory of gases. Both the theory and the ideal gas law predict that gases compressed to very high pressures and cooled to very low temperatures should still behave like gases, albeit cold, dense ones. As gases are compressed and cooled, however, they invariably condense to form liquids, although very low temperatures are needed to liquefy light elements such as helium (for He, 4.2 K at 1 atm pressure). Liquefaction can be viewed as an extreme deviation from ideal gas behavior. It occurs when the molecules of a gas are cooled to the point where they no longer possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular attractive forces. The precise combination of temperature and pressure needed to liquefy a gas depends strongly on its molar mass and structure, with heavier and more complex molecules usually liquefying at higher temperatures. In general, substances with large van der Waals acoefficients are relatively easy to liquefy because large a coefficients indicate relatively strong intermolecular attractive interactions. Conversely, small molecules with only light elements have small a coefficients, indicating weak intermolecular interactions, and they are relatively difficult to liquefy. Gas liquefaction is used on a massive scale to separate O2, N2, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. After a sample of air is liquefied, the mixture is."}

{"prompt":"Question: In plants, a high concentration of iaa inhibits what?\nOptions:\n A. Cell reproduction\nB. same elongation\nC. cell elongation\nD. technology elongation","completion":"cell elongation\nExplanation: the bottom of the cell. In roots, a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation. The effect slows growth on the lower side of the root, while cells develop normally on the upper side. IAA has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher concentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up. After the shoot or root begin to grow vertically, the amyloplasts return to their normal position. Other hypotheses\u2014involving the entire cell in the gravitropism effect\u2014have been proposed to explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak gravitropic response."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the process of larva becoming an adult called?\nOptions:\n A. parthenogenesis\nB. metamorphosis\nC. synthesis\nD. evolution","completion":"metamorphosis\nExplanation: After hatching, most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood. The larvae may look very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the arthropod is called a pupa. It may or may not spend this stage inside a special container called a cocoon. A familiar example of arthropod metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult) (see Figure below ). Distinctive life stages and metamorphosis are highly adaptive. They allow functions to be divided among different life stages.

They are the simplest hydrocarbons. They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. You can see an example of a saturated hydrocarbon in Figure below . Each carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms in this compound, which is named ethane."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food called?\nOptions:\n A. spermatogenesis\nB. photochemistry\nC. atherosclerosis\nD. photosynthesis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Recall that eukaryotic organisms also include animals, protists, and fungi. Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA, and membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the carbohydrate glucose. Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of photosynthesis, and are known as producers and autotrophs. Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts. Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one cell. There are no single-celled plants. Recall that some protists, such as algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants. Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular."}

{"prompt":"Question: Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of what?\nOptions:\n A. reactions\nB. particles\nC. chemistry\nD. thermodynamics","completion":"thermodynamics\nExplanation: One major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level. The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 46.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal\/m2\/yr (kilocalories per square meter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal\/m2\/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal\/m2\/yr, and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal\/m2\/yr. Thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in this ecosystem."}
{"prompt":"Question: The phase transition of a substance changing from a liquid state to a gaseous state is an example of what?\nOptions:\n A. trichina\nB. entropoy\nC. spirogyra\nD. catostrophy","completion":"entropoy\nExplanation: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid."}

{"prompt":"Question: The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of which effect?\nOptions:\n A. warp effect\nB. coreolis effect\nC. polar effect\nD. doppler effect","completion":"doppler effect\nExplanation: 17.4 Doppler Effect and Sonic Booms The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the Doppler effect. The high-pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer. The closer the motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. It is so familiar that it is used to imply motion and children often mimic it in play. The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the observer. Although less familiar, this effect is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For example, if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell\u2019s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift. The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler (1803\u20131853), who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example, had musicians play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks as a train passed by. Their music was observed both on and off the train, and changes in frequency were measured. What causes the Doppler shift? Figure 17.14, Figure 17.15, and Figure 17.16 compare sound waves emitted by stationary and moving sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from the point where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of the spheres representing the air compressions in the sound wave centered on the same."}

Worldwide, it is also used to irradiate food, an application that promises to grow in the future. Food irradiation is the treatment of food with ionizing radiation. It is used to reduce pest infestation and to delay spoilage and prevent illness caused by microorganisms. Food irradiation is controversial. Proponents see it as superior to pasteurization, preservatives, and insecticides, supplanting dangerous chemicals with a more effective process. Opponents see its safety as unproven, perhaps leaving worse toxic residues as well as presenting an environmental hazard at treatment sites. In developing countries, food irradiation might increase crop production by 25.0% or more, and reduce food spoilage by a similar amount. It is used chiefly to treat spices and some fruits, and in some countries, red meat, poultry, and vegetables. Over 40 countries have approved food irradiation at some level. Food irradiation exposes food to large doses of."}

{"prompt":"Question: How does a cell's membrane keep extracellular materials from mixing with it's internal components?\nOptions:\n A. provides a barrier\nB. absorbs extracellular materials\nC. repels extracellular materials\nD. destroys extracellular materials","completion":"provides a barrier\nExplanation: CHAPTER REVIEW 3.1 The Cell Membrane The cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell, separating its internal components from the extracellular environment. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid \u201ctails\u201d and hydrophilic external phosphate \u201cheads. \u201d Various membrane proteins are scattered throughout the bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it peripherally. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only a limited number of materials to diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that cross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-requiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport processes. During passive transport, materials move by simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the membrane, down their concentration gradient. Water passes through the membrane in a diffusion process called osmosis. During active transport, energy is expended to assist material movement across the membrane in a direction against their concentration gradient. Active transport may take place with the help of protein pumps or through the use of vesicles."}

{"prompt":"Question: At the earth\u2019s surface, the air pressure exerted on you is a result of the weight of what above you?\nOptions:\n A. magnetic force\nB. humidity\nC. air\nD. water","completion":"air\nExplanation: 11.4 Variation of Pressure with Depth in a Fluid If your ears have ever popped on a plane flight or ached during a deep dive in a swimming pool, you have experienced the effect of depth on pressure in a fluid. At the Earth\u2019s surface, the air pressure exerted on you is a result of the weight of air above you. This pressure is reduced as you climb up in altitude and the weight of air above you decreases. Under water, the pressure exerted on you increases with increasing depth. In this case, the pressure being exerted upon you is a result of both the weight of water above you and that of the atmosphere above you. You may notice an air pressure change on an elevator ride that transports you many stories, but you need only dive a meter or so below the surface of a pool to feel a pressure increase. The difference is that water is much denser than air, about 775 times as dense. Consider the container in Figure 11.10. Its bottom supports the weight of the fluid in it. Let us calculate the pressure exerted on the bottom by the weight of the fluid. That pressure is the weight of the fluid mg divided by the area A supporting it (the area of the bottom of the container):."}

It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second kind of marine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome. Ocean The physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms. The ocean is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zone has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone. The intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land (Figure 44.21). Generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of tides. Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high tide. Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time. The shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves (Figure 44.22). The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) are tough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud."}

{"prompt":"Question: In his work with pea plants, mendel performed what, which involves mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits?\nOptions:\n A. cross-breeding\nB. hybridization\nC. assimilation\nD. mutations","completion":"hybridization\nExplanation: These are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance. Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. Plants used in first-generation crosses were called P, or parental generation, plants (Figure 8.3). Mendel collected the seeds produced by the P plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the F1, or the first filial (filial = daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2, or second filial, generation. Mendel\u2019s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 generation, F4 generation, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P, F1, and F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis of Mendel\u2019s postulates."}

{"prompt":"Question: Digestion and respiration are both facilitated by the pharynx, more commonly called the what?\nOptions:\n A. throat\nB. esophagus\nC. sinus\nD. nose","completion":"throat\nExplanation: The Pharynx The pharynx (throat) is involved in both digestion and respiration. It receives food and air from the mouth, and air from the nasal cavities. When food enters the pharynx, involuntary muscle contractions close off the air passageways. A short tube of skeletal muscle lined with a mucous membrane, the pharynx runs from the posterior oral and nasal cavities to the opening of the esophagus and larynx. It has three subdivisions. The most superior, the nasopharynx, is involved only in breathing and speech. The other two subdivisions, the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx, are used for both breathing and digestion. The oropharynx begins inferior to the nasopharynx and is continuous below with the laryngopharynx (Figure 23.12). The inferior border of the laryngopharynx connects to the esophagus, whereas the anterior portion connects to the larynx, allowing air to flow into the bronchial tree."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the pores in plants that keep certain gases and liquids in and out called?\nOptions:\n A. lesions\nB. stomata\nC. chloroplasts\nD. stigmata","completion":"stomata\nExplanation: Additional Land Plant Adaptations As plants adapted to dry land and became independent of the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and structures made their appearance. Early land plants did not grow above a few inches off the ground, and on these low mats, they competed for light. By evolving a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. Because air offers substantially less support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). The evolution of vascular tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a necessary prerequisite for plants to evolve larger bodies. The vascular system contains xylem and phloem tissues. Xylem conducts water and minerals taken from the soil up to the shoot; phloem transports food derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. The root system that evolved to take up water and minerals also anchored the increasingly taller shoot in the soil. In land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle coats the aerial parts of the plant: leaves and stems. The cuticle also prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Stomata, or pores, that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor therefore appeared in plants as they moved into drier habitats. Plants cannot avoid predatory animals. Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex organic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. These toxic compounds can cause severe diseases and even death. Additionally, as plants coevolved with animals, sweet and nutritious metabolites were developed to lure animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. Plants have been coevolving with animal associates for hundreds of millions of years (Figure 14.6)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the cone-like structures that contain sporangia called?\nOptions:\n A. contrail\nB. strobili\nC. medulla\nD. gametes","completion":"strobili\nExplanation: Leaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili A third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their increased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive cells of phloem tissue. The existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants. The first type of leaf is the microphyll, or \u201clittle leaf,\u201d which can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian. A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system. A single unbranched vein\u2014a bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloem\u2014runs through the center of the leaf. Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches, or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities. Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls, or \u201cbig leaves\u201d, which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins. Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution. Their complex networks of veins suggest that several branches may have combined into a flattened organ, with the gaps between the branches being filled with photosynthetic tissue. In addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants. Pine cones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers are all sporophylls\u2014leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia. Strobili are cone-like structures that contain sporangia. They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term means an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce?\nOptions:\n A. homozone\nB. hybrid zone\nC. heterozone\nD. common zone","completion":"hybrid zone\nExplanation: Reconnection After speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with. An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids, is called a hybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.22). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, reinforcement of speciation occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues."}

An electrical current can be used to block back pain. The possibility of using electrical current to stimulate muscle action in paralyzed limbs, perhaps allowing paraplegics to walk, is under study. TV dramatizations in which electrical shocks are used to bring a heart attack victim out of ventricular fibrillation (a massively irregular, often fatal, beating of the heart) are more than common. Yet most electrical shock fatalities occur because a current put the heart into fibrillation. A pacemaker uses electrical shocks to stimulate the heart to beat properly. Some fatal shocks do not produce burns, but warts can be safely burned off with electric current (though freezing using liquid nitrogen is now more common). Of course, there are consistent explanations for these disparate effects. The major factors upon which the effects of electrical shock depend are 1. The amount of current."}

{"prompt":"Question: An isometric type of what occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint?\nOptions:\n A. contraction\nB. compression\nC. extension\nD. acceleration","completion":"contraction\nExplanation: 10.4 | Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Explain concentric, isotonic, and eccentric contractions \u2022 Describe the length-tension relationship \u2022 Describe the three phases of a muscle twitch \u2022 Define wave summation, tetanus, and treppe To move an object, referred to as load, the sarcomeres in the muscle fibers of the skeletal muscle must shorten. The force generated by the contraction of the muscle (or shortening of the sarcomeres) is called muscle tension. However, muscle tension also is generated when the muscle is contracting against a load that does not move, resulting in two main types of skeletal muscle contractions: isotonic contractions and isometric contractions. In isotonic contractions, where the tension in the muscle stays constant, a load is moved as the length of the muscle changes (shortens). There are two types of isotonic contractions: concentric and eccentric. A concentric contraction involves the muscle shortening to move a load. An example of this is the biceps brachii muscle contracting when a hand weight is brought upward with increasing muscle tension. As the biceps brachii contract, the angle of the elbow joint decreases as the forearm is brought toward the body. Here, the biceps brachii contracts as sarcomeres in its muscle fibers are shortening and cross-bridges form; the myosin heads pull the actin. An eccentric contraction occurs as the muscle tension diminishes and the muscle lengthens. In this case, the hand weight is lowered in a slow and controlled manner as the amount of crossbridges being activated by nervous system stimulation decreases. In this case, as tension is released from the biceps brachii, the angle of the elbow joint increases. Eccentric contractions are also used for movement and balance of the body. An isometric contraction occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint. Isometric contractions involve sarcomere shortening and increasing muscle tension, but do not move a load, as the force produced cannot overcome the resistance provided by the load. For example, if one attempts to lift a hand weight that is too heavy, there will be sarcomere activation and shortening to a point, and ever-increasing muscle tension, but no change in the angle of the elbow joint. In everyday living, isometric contractions are active in maintaining posture and maintaining bone and joint stability. However, holding your head in an upright position occurs not because the muscles cannot move the head, but."}

{"prompt":"Question: If a quantity of a reactant remains unconsumed after complete reaction has occurred, it is?\nOptions:\n A. reduced\nB. in excess\nC. static\nD. missing","completion":"in excess\nExplanation: The stoichiometry of a reaction describes the relative amounts of reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation. A stoichiometric quantity of a reactant is the amount necessary to react completely with the other reactant(s). If a quantity of a reactant remains unconsumed after complete reaction has occurred, it is in excess. The reactant that is consumed first and limits the amount of product(s) that can be obtained is the limiting reactant. To identify the limiting reactant, calculate the number of moles of each reactant present and compare this ratio to the mole ratio of the reactants in the balanced chemical equation. The maximum amount of product(s) that can be obtained in a reaction from a given amount of reactant(s) is the theoretical yield of the reaction. The actual yieldis the amount of product(s) actually obtained in the reaction; it cannot exceed the theoretical yield. The percent yield of a reaction is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage."}

It constantly pulls you toward the center of the planet. It prevents you and everything else on Earth from being flung out into space as the planet spins on its axis. It also pulls objects above the surface, from meteors to skydivers, down to the ground. Gravity between Earth and the moon and between Earth and artificial satellites keeps all these objects circling around Earth. Gravity also keeps Earth moving around the sun."}
{"prompt":"Question: In a medium, the closer the distribution of the material gets to what state, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes?\nOptions:\n A. erosion\nB. gas\nC. equilibrium\nD. elastic","completion":"equilibrium\nExplanation: Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of the concentration gradients of other materials. Additionally, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. Several factors affect the rate of diffusion. \u2022 Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes. \u2022 Mass of the molecules diffusing: More massive molecules move more slowly, because it is more difficult for them to move between the molecules of the substance they are moving through; therefore, they diffuse more slowly. \u2022 Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the rate of diffusion. \u2022 Solvent density: As the density of the solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. The molecules slow down because they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium."}

In this lesson, we will see how the atomic orbitals interact to share valence electrons and form different types of covalent bonds."}
{"prompt":"Question: While the numerical aperture can be used to compare resolutions of various objectives, it does not indicate how far the lens could be from the what?\nOptions:\n A. microscope\nB. diameter\nC. focal point\nD. specimen","completion":"specimen\nExplanation: While the numerical aperture can be used to compare resolutions of various objectives, it does not indicate how far the lens could be from the specimen. This is specified by the \u201cworking distance,\u201d which is the distance (in mm usually) from the front lens element of the objective to the specimen, or cover glass. The higher the NA the closer the lens will be to the specimen and the more chances there are of breaking the cover slip and damaging both the specimen and the lens. The focal length of an objective lens is different than the working distance. This is because objective lenses are made of a combination of lenses and the focal length is measured from inside the barrel. The working distance is a parameter that microscopists can use more readily as it is measured from the outermost lens. The working distance decreases as the NA and magnification both increase."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the first leaf developed inside an embryo?\nOptions:\n A. exon\nB. polylepis\nC. cotyledon\nD. gastromyzon","completion":"cotyledon\nExplanation: The embryo develops from a fertilized egg.

{"prompt":"Question: Oxytocin, which stimulates the contractions of labor, is a type of what?\nOptions:\n A. metabolite\nB. hormone\nC. inhibitor\nD. steroid","completion":"hormone\nExplanation: A common sign that labor will be short is the so-called \u201cbloody show. \u201d During pregnancy, a plug of mucus accumulates in the cervical canal, blocking the entrance to the uterus. Approximately 1\u20132 days prior to the onset of true labor, this plug loosens and is expelled, along with a small amount of blood. Meanwhile, the posterior pituitary has been boosting its secretion of oxytocin, a hormone that stimulates the contractions of labor. At the same time, the myometrium increases its sensitivity to oxytocin by expressing more receptors for this hormone. As labor nears, oxytocin begins to stimulate stronger, more painful uterine contractions, which\u2014in a positive feedback loop\u2014stimulate the secretion of prostaglandins from fetal membranes. Like oxytocin, prostaglandins also enhance uterine contractile strength. The fetal pituitary also secretes oxytocin, which increases prostaglandins even further. Given the importance of oxytocin and prostaglandins to the initiation and maintenance of labor, it is not surprising that, when a pregnancy is not progressing to labor and needs to be induced, a pharmaceutical version of these compounds (called pitocin) is administered by intravenous drip. Finally, stretching of the myometrium and cervix by a full-term fetus in the vertex (head-down) position is regarded as a stimulant to uterine contractions. The sum of these changes initiates the regular contractions known as true labor, which become more powerful and more frequent with time. The pain of labor is attributed to myometrial hypoxia during uterine contractions."}

Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which glows after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light and X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate. The plate was similar to film that\u2019s used today to take X-rays. You can see an example of an X-ray in Figure below . As Becquerel predicted, the uranium left an image on the photographic plate. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight."}

{"prompt":"Question: What happens to the volume of the gas when temperature increases but amount of gas and its pressure are constant?\nOptions:\n A. nothing\nB. volume increases\nC. volume remains constant\nD. volume decreases","completion":"volume increases\nExplanation: There are other measurable characteristics of a gas. One of them is temperature (T). Perhaps one can vary the temperature of a gas sample and note what effect it has on the other properties of the gas. Early scientists did just this, discovering that if the amount of a gas and its pressure are kept constant, then changing the temperature changes the volume (V). As temperature increases, volume increases; as temperature decreases, volume decreases. We say that these two characteristics are directly related. A mathematical relationship between V and T should be possible except for one thought: what temperature scale should we use? We know from Chapter 2 \"Measurements\" that science uses several possible temperature scales. Experiments show that the volume of a gas is related to its absolute temperature in Kelvin, not its temperature in degrees Celsius. If the temperature of a gas is expressed in kelvins, then experiments show that the ratio of volume to temperature is a constant:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do we call the formation of a gas from a liquid at temperatures below the boiling point?\nOptions:\n A. melting\nB. evaporation\nC. pulverization\nD. steaming","completion":"evaporation\nExplanation: There are some properties that all liquids have. The liquid that we are most familiar with is probably water, and it has these properties. Other liquids have them as well, which is something to keep in mind. All liquids have a certain portion of their particles having enough energy to enter the gas phase, and if these particles are at the surface of the liquid, they do so ( - ball-ch10_s03_f01). The formation of a gas from a liquid at temperatures below the boiling point is called evaporation. At these temperatures, the material in the gas phase is called vapor, rather than gas; the term gas is reserved for when the gas phase is the stable phase. Figure 10.5 Evaporation."}

{"prompt":"Question: Nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building blocks of nucleic acids and these?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. cells\nC. lipids\nD. follicles","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Cooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes: Nitrogen Fixation Nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be \u201cfixed,\u201d meaning it is converted into ammonia (NH3) either biologically or abiotically. Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or by industrial processes. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and Frankia spp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis, BNF is the second most important biological process on Earth. The equation representing the process is as follows."}

{"prompt":"Question: Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of what, a condition known as trisomy?\nOptions:\n A. genome\nB. variation\nC. DNA\nD. chromosome","completion":"chromosome\nExplanation: Chromosomal Disorders Sometimes a genetic disease is not caused by a mutation in a gene, but by the presence of an incorrect number of chromosomes. For example, Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21. This is known as trisomy 21. The most common cause of trisomy 21 is chromosomal nondisjunction during meiosis. The frequency of nondisjunction events appears to increase with age, so the frequency of bearing a child with Down syndrome increases in women over 36. The age of the father matters less because nondisjunction is much less likely to occur in a sperm than in an egg. Whereas Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of a chromosome, Turner syndrome is caused by having just one copy of the X chromosome. This is known as monosomy. The affected child is always female. Women with Turner syndrome are sterile because their sexual organs do not mature."}

{"prompt":"Question: Weight is a measure of what force pulling down on an object?\nOptions:\n A. gravity\nB. light\nC. distortion\nD. motion","completion":"gravity\nExplanation: Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object, whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object. Which force is greater determines whether an object sinks or floats. Look at the Figure below . On the left, the object\u2019s weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object floats. On the right, the object\u2019s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, so the object sinks."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do puffer fish produce to protect itself?\nOptions:\n A. teeth\nB. enzymes\nC. hormones\nD. venom","completion":"venom\nExplanation: This odd-looking creature is a fish called a puffer fish.

{"prompt":"Question: The mercury or alcohol in a common glass what changes its volume as the temperature changes?\nOptions:\n A. calculator\nB. compass\nC. barometer\nD. thermometer","completion":"thermometer\nExplanation: Conversion of Temperature Units We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler. To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 \u00b0C is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 \u00b0C as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 \u00b0F and the boiling temperature as 212 \u00b0F. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees). Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another (y = mx). Using familiar length units as one example: \u239e \u239b length in feet = \u239d 1 ft \u23a0 \u00d7 length in inches 12 in."}

{"prompt":"Question: Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through what?\nOptions:\n A. Solid\nB. tissue\nC. fluid\nD. Metal","completion":"fluid\nExplanation: Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid. Particles transfer energy by moving from warmer to cooler areas. That\u2019s how energy is transferred in the soup in Figure above . Particles of soup near the bottom of the pot get hot first. They have more energy so they spread out and become less dense. With lower density, these particles rise to the top of the pot (see Figure below ). By the time they reach the top of the pot they have cooled off. They have less energy to move apart, so they become denser. With greater density, the particles sink to the bottom of the pot, and the cycle repeats. This loop of moving particles is called a convection current ."}

{"prompt":"Question: As blood glucose levels rise what is released from the pancreas?\nOptions:\n A. insulin\nB. adrenaline\nC. estrogen\nD. hemoglobin","completion":"insulin\nExplanation: 24.5 Metabolic States of the Body There are three main metabolic states of the body: absorptive (fed), postabsorptive (fasting), and starvation. During any given day, your metabolism switches between absorptive and postabsorptive states. Starvation states happen very rarely in generally well-nourished individuals. When the body is fed, glucose, fats, and proteins are absorbed across the intestinal membrane and enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system to be used immediately for fuel. Any excess is stored for later fasting stages. As blood glucose levels rise, the pancreas releases insulin to stimulate the uptake of glucose by hepatocytes in the liver, muscle cells\/fibers, and adipocytes (fat cells), and to promote its conversion to glycogen. As the postabsorptive state begins, glucose levels drop, and there is a corresponding drop in insulin levels. Falling glucose levels trigger the pancreas to release glucagon to turn off glycogen synthesis in the liver and stimulate its breakdown into glucose. The glucose is released into the bloodstream to serve as a fuel source for cells throughout the body. If glycogen stores are depleted during fasting, alternative sources, including fatty acids and proteins, can be metabolized and used as fuel. When the body once again enters the absorptive state after fasting, fats and proteins are digested and used to replenish fat."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the devices placed in electric circuits where charge can build up, which store energy when charged and release it when they discharge?\nOptions:\n A. resistors\nB. antennas\nC. generators\nD. capacitors","completion":"capacitors\nExplanation: When current flows through wires and resistors in a circuit as a result of a difference in electric potential, charge does not build up significantly anywhere on its path. Capacitors are devices placed in electric circuits where charge can build up. The amount of charge a capacitor can store before it \u201cfills up\u201d depends on its shape and how much electric potential is applied. The ratio of charge stored in a capacitor to the voltage applied is called its capacitance , measured in Farads . The larger the electric potential in volts, the stronger the electric field that is used to \u201ccram\u201d the charge into the device. Any capacitor will fill up with enough charge. Capacitors store energy when charged, and release it when they discharge."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the two components of the autonomic nervous system?\nOptions:\n A. parasympathetic and sympathetic\nB. empathetic and sympathetic\nC. crystallisation and sympathetic\nD. neurons and sympathetic","completion":"parasympathetic and sympathetic\nExplanation: 31.3 Peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and sympathetic. The sympathetic nervous system is the \"fight or flight\" or fright response and results in an increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the first neuron is short and the second neuron is long. The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system. Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an effect on the CNS. Drugs act by affecting the neuron and how likely it is to fire an action potential. Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood flow."}

{"prompt":"Question: In the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for what?\nOptions:\n A. phosphate\nB. glucose\nC. chloride\nD. oxygen","completion":"chloride\nExplanation: 39.4 Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is comprised of two alpha and two beta subunits that surround an iron-containing heme group. Oxygen readily binds this heme group. The ability of oxygen to bind increases as more oxygen molecules are bound to heme. Disease states and altered conditions in the body can affect the binding ability of oxygen, and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate from hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via three methods. It is dissolved directly in the blood, bound to plasma proteins or hemoglobin, or converted into bicarbonate. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported as part of the bicarbonate system. Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells. Inside, carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide into + + carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is subsequently hydrolyzed into bicarbonate (HCO\u2212 3 ) and H . The H ion binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and bicarbonate is transported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a chloride ion. This is called the chloride shift. Bicarbonate leaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma. In the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. The H+ dissociates from hemoglobin and combines with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which further catalyzes the reaction to convert carbonic acid back into carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide is then expelled from the lungs."}
{"prompt":"Question: Boron only occurs naturally in compounds with what element?\nOptions:\n A. helium\nB. nitrogen\nC. oxygen\nD. carbon","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Boron and Silicon Boron constitutes less than 0.001% by weight of the earth\u2019s crust. In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including the desert areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, Na2B4O7\u22c510H2O. Elemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated with concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3). Reduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95\u201398.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous powder: B 2 O 3(s) + 3Mg(s) \u27f6 2B(s) + 3MgO(s) An amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a true solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron begins with conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride. The next step is to heat a mixture of boron trichloride and hydrogen: 1500 \u00b0C."}

{"prompt":"Question: What happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because a blood vessel is blocked?\nOptions:\n A. heart attack\nB. fast heart beat\nC. heart burn\nD. pass out","completion":"heart attack\nExplanation: A heart attack happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because a blood vessel is blocked. If cardiac muscle is starved of oxygen for more than roughly five minutes, it will die. Cardiac muscle cells cannot be replaced, so once they die, they are dead forever. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States. The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack and cause part of the heart muscle to die ( Figure below ). Maybe one day stem cells will be used to replace dead cardiac muscle cells."}

In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Although these hormones are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction. Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems. Male Hormones At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time. FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells located in the walls of the seminiferous tubules to begin promoting spermatogenesis (Figure 18.16). LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig, located in between the walls of the seminiferous tubules, to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood. Testosterone stimulates spermatogenesis. This hormone is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence. The secondary sex characteristics in males include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, an increase in muscle bulk, and the beginnings of the sex drive."}

Negative effects on the environment have already occurred because of some GMOs. For example, corn has been created that has a gene for a pesticide. The corn plants have accidentally cross-pollinated nearby milkweeds. Monarch butterfly larvae depend on milkweeds for food. When they eat milkweeds with the pesticide gene, they are poisoned. This may threaten the survival of the monarch species as well as other species that eat monarchs. Do the benefits of the genetically modified corn outweigh the risks? What do you think?."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a solution that resists dramatic changes in ph?\nOptions:\n A. inert\nB. neutral\nC. buffer\nD. stable","completion":"buffer\nExplanation: As indicated in Section 12.4 \"Strong and Weak Acids and Bases and Their Salts\", weak acids are relatively common, even in the foods we eat. But we occasionally encounter a strong acid or base, such as stomach acid, which has a strongly acidic pH of 1.7. By definition, strong acids and bases can produce a relatively large amount of H+ or OH\u2212ions and consequently have marked chemical activities. In addition, very small amounts of strong acids and bases can change the pH of a solution very quickly. If 1 mL of stomach acid [approximated as 0.1 M HCl(aq)] were added to the bloodstream and no correcting mechanism were present, the pH of the blood would decrease from about 7.4 to about 4.7\u2014a pH that is not conducive to continued living. Fortunately, the body has a mechanism for minimizing such dramatic pH changes. The mechanism involves a buffer, a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH. Buffers do so by being composed of certain pairs of solutes: either a weak acid plus a salt derived from that weak acid or a weak base plus a salt of that weak base. For example, a buffer can be composed of dissolved HC2H3O2 (a weak acid) and NaC2H3O2 (the salt derived from that weak acid). Another example of a buffer is a solution containing NH3 (a weak base) and NH4Cl (a salt derived from that weak base). Let us use an HC2H3O2\/NaC2H3O2 buffer to demonstrate how buffers work. If a strong base\u2014a source of OH\u2212(aq) ions\u2014is added to the buffer solution, those OH\u2212 ions will react with the HC2H3O2 in an acid-base reaction:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species?\nOptions:\n A. example embryology\nB. prenatal biology\nC. diversified embryology\nD. comparative embryology","completion":"comparative embryology\nExplanation: Comparative embryology is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species. Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage.

During the catabolism, or breakdown, of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats. Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body. Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia, which raises the pH of body fluids. The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system. Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water. Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic. Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes. The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric acid. Mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term of a phase change if solid water has it's average kinetic energy increased to change it to liquid water?\nOptions:\n A. melting\nB. boiling\nC. freezing\nD. evaporation","completion":"melting\nExplanation: Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer 1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps\u2014temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change). Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account."}

{"prompt":"Question: The mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the what of the molecule?\nOptions:\n A. variation\nB. weight\nC. diameter\nD. density","completion":"diameter\nExplanation: If you have ever been in a room when a piping hot pizza was delivered, you have been made aware of the fact that gaseous molecules can quickly spread throughout a room, as evidenced by the pleasant aroma that soon reaches your nose. Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired target. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the molecule In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in Figure 9.27). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly\u2014regions of higher concentration have more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted in Figure 9.27. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations are the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net transfer of molecules occurs)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What field of study is called the language of science?\nOptions:\n A. logic\nB. linguistics\nC. physics\nD. mathematics","completion":"mathematics\nExplanation: The field of science has gotten so big that it is common to separate it into more specific fields. First, there is mathematics, the language of science. All scientific fields use mathematics to express themselves\u2014some more than others. Physics and astronomy are scientific fields concerned with the fundamental interactions between matter and energy. Chemistry, as defined previously, is the study of the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. Biology is the study of living organisms, while geology is the study of the earth. Other sciences can be named as well. Understand that these fields are not always completely separate; the boundaries between scientific fields are not always readily apparent. Therefore, a scientist may be labeled a biochemist if he or she studies the chemistry of biological organisms. Finally, understand that science can be either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative implies a description of the quality of an object. For example, physical properties are generally qualitative descriptions: sulfur is yellow, your math book is heavy, or that statue is pretty. A quantitative description represents the specific amount of something; it means knowing how much of something is present, usually by counting or measuring it. As such, some quantitative descriptions would include 25 students in a class, 650 pages in a book, or a velocity of 66 miles per hour. Quantitative expressions are very important in science; they are also very important in chemistry."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are reversible physical changes in matter called?\nOptions:\n A. changes of state\nB. chemical change\nC. alterations\nD. transformations","completion":"changes of state\nExplanation: Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matter\u2019s chemical makeup or chemical properties. For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water and can change back to liquid water again."}
{"prompt":"Question: What paired organs that are part of the urinary system play the prime role in excretion?\nOptions:\n A. ovaries\nB. kidneys\nC. liver\nD. lungs","completion":"kidneys\nExplanation: Each of the above organs of excretion is also part of another body system. For example, the large intestine and liver are part of the digestive system, and the lungs are part of the respiratory system. The kidneys are the main organs of excretion. They are part of the urinary system."}
{"prompt":"Question: Atoms that have gained electrons and become negatively charged are called what?\nOptions:\n A. negative atoms\nB. cations\nC. negative ions\nD. anions","completion":"negative ions\nExplanation: Changes to the nucleus of an atom require tremendous amounts of energy, so protons are not easily gained or lost by atoms. Electrons, on the other hand, are held fairly loosely and can often be removed quite easily. When an object loses some electrons, the remaining object is now positively charged because it has an excess of protons. The electrons may either remain free or may attach to another object. In that case, the extra electrons cause that object to become negatively charged. Atoms that have lost electrons and become positively charged are called positive ions, and atoms that have gained electrons and become negatively charged are called negative ions ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from the nucleus?\nOptions:\n A. radioactivity\nB. magnetism\nC. electrolysis\nD. electromagnetism","completion":"radioactivity\nExplanation: Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from the nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation . Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. When they do, they gain or lose protons. Then the atoms become different elements. (Be careful not to confuse this radiation with electromagnetic radiation, which has to do with the light given off by atoms as they absorb and then emit energy. )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What system is involved in diseases that include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis?\nOptions:\n A. circulatory system\nB. immune system\nC. nervous system\nD. digestion system","completion":"immune system\nExplanation: One example is type 1 diabetes . In this disease, the immune system attacks cells of the pancreas. Other examples are multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In multiple sclerosis , the immune system attacks nerve cells. This causes weakness and pain. In rheumatoid arthritis , the immune system attacks the cells of joints. This causes joint damage and pain."}
{"prompt":"Question: Both diffusion and effusion are related to the speed at which what objects move?\nOptions:\n A. electricity\nB. copper molecules\nC. solids\nD. gas molecules","completion":"gas molecules\nExplanation: A related process to diffusion is the effusion. Effusion is the process of a confined gas escaping through a tiny hole in its container. Effusion can be observed by the fact that a helium-filled balloon will stop floating and sink to the floor after a day or so. This is because the helium gas effuses through tiny pores in the balloon. Both diffusion and effusion are related to the speed at which various gas molecules move. Gases that have a lower molar mass effuse and diffuse at a faster rate than gases that have a higher molar mass."}

{"prompt":"Question: What disease unique to humans and is caused by two variola viruses?\nOptions:\n A. AIDS\nB. diabetes\nC. ebola\nD. smallpox","completion":"smallpox\nExplanation: A worldwide vaccination campaign by the World Health Organization led to the eradication of smallpox in 1979. Smallpox is a contagious disease unique to humans and is caused by two Variola viruses. The eradication of smallpox was possible because humans are the only carriers of the virus. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated from nature. Scientists are hoping to eradicate polio next."}
{"prompt":"Question: What chemical reaction is the opposite of oxidation?\nOptions:\n A. mutation\nB. reduction\nC. condensation\nD. evaporation","completion":"reduction\nExplanation: The chemical reaction that is the opposite of oxidation is called reduction. Following from the notion that oxidation was originally thought to mean only the addition of oxygen, reduction was thought to be only the removal of oxygen from a substance. Many naturally occurring metal ores are present as oxides. The pure metals can be extracted by reduction. Iron is obtained from iron(III) oxide by reacting with carbon at high temperatures."}
{"prompt":"Question: The measure of a substances entropy at 25 degrees celsius is known as it's?\nOptions:\n A. specific entropy\nB. standard entropy\nC. new entropy\nD. limited entropy","completion":"standard entropy\nExplanation: As the temperature of a perfect crystal increases, its particles start to vibrate slightly around their optimal positions, thus increasing the entropy of the system. The dependence of entropy on temperature varies by substance, so the only temperature at which all crystals have the same entropy is absolute zero. The standard entropy of a substance is a measure of its entropy at 25\u00b0C and 1 atm of pressure. Like standard enthalpy of formation values, standard entropies are tabulated for a wide range of substances. However, unlike enthalpy of formation values, all standard entropy values are positive, because the absolute zero for entropy is the most ordered possible state. Additionally, this means that pure elements in their standard states do not have a standard entropy of zero."}

{"prompt":"Question: Ice ages, continental drift, and giant meteorites striking earth have caused what phenomenon?\nOptions:\n A. gravity\nB. waves\nC. extinction\nD. depletion","completion":"extinction\nExplanation: The evolution of life on Earth wasn\u2019t always smooth and steady\u2014far from it. Living things had to cope with some astounding changes. Giant meteorites struck Earth\u2019s surface. Continents drifted and shifted. Ice ages buried the planet in snow and ice for millions of years at a time. At least five times, many, if not most, of Earth\u2019s living things went extinct. Extinction occurs when a species completely dies out and no members of the species remain. But life on Earth was persistent. Each time, it came back more numerous and diverse than before."}

{"prompt":"Question: An elastic collision is one that conserves internal energy of what type?\nOptions:\n A. thermal\nB. seismic\nC. potential\nD. kinetic","completion":"kinetic\nExplanation: 8.4 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension Let us consider various types of two-object collisions. These collisions are the easiest to analyze, and they illustrate many of the physical principles involved in collisions. The conservation of momentum principle is very useful here, and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero. We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line\u2014a one-dimensional problem. An elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy. Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system. Figure 8.6 illustrates an elastic collision in which internal kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. Truly elastic collisions can only be achieved with subatomic particles, such as electrons striking nuclei. Macroscopic collisions can be very nearly, but not quite, elastic\u2014some kinetic energy is always converted into other forms of energy such as heat transfer due to friction and sound. One macroscopic collision that is nearly elastic is that of two steel blocks on ice. Another nearly elastic collision is that between two carts with spring bumpers on an air track. Icy surfaces and air tracks are nearly frictionless, more readily allowing nearly elastic collisions on them. Elastic Collision An elastic collision is one that conserves internal kinetic energy. Internal Kinetic Energy Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the set of seventeen chemical elements possessing particular importance for a variety of industrial processes, used frequently in modern technology?\nOptions:\n A. base chemicals\nB. fossil fuel\nC. rare earth metals\nD. reactive elements","completion":"rare earth metals\nExplanation: The rare earth metals are a set of seventeen chemical elements (the lanthanide series plus scandium and yttrium) that have particular importance for a variety of industrial processes and are used frequently in modern technology. Despite their name, rare earth metals are actually relatively abundant in the earth\u2019s crust. However, the extraction of many of these metals is quite difficult and has made their supply somewhat limited. They are highly sought after for this reason. Figure below shows the rare earth metals."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the hormone produced in high-stress situations?\nOptions:\n A. testosterone\nB. thyroxine\nC. adrenalin\nD. somatostatin","completion":"adrenalin\nExplanation: In the health sciences, the concentration of a solution is typically expressed asparts per thousand (ppt), indicated as a proportion. For example, adrenalin, the hormone produced in high-stress situations, is available in a 1:1000 solution, or one gram of adrenalin per 1000 g of solution. The labels on bottles of commercial reagents often describe the contents in terms of mass percentage. Sulfuric acid, for example, is sold as a 95% aqueous solution, or 95 g of H2SO4 per 100 g of solution. Parts per million and parts per billion are used to describe concentrations of highly dilute solutions. These measurements correspond to milligrams and micrograms of solute per kilogram of solution, respectively. For dilute aqueous solutions, this is equal to milligrams and micrograms of solute per liter of solution (assuming a density of 1.0 g\/mL)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Like all tetrapods except birds and mammals, frogs possess a heart with what structure?\nOptions:\n A. three chambers\nB. One Chamber\nC. four chambers\nD. eight chambers","completion":"three chambers\nExplanation: Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed finger-like parts, and the lack of a tail. They also have a three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals. Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land. They move easily on land by jumping or climbing. To become great jumpers, frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones. They also have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae. Frog and toad skin hangs loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a compound in which all of the atoms are connected to one another by covalent bonds?\nOptions:\n A. covalent bond element\nB. covalent mixture\nC. compound metal\nD. covalent network solid","completion":"covalent network solid\nExplanation: One type of molecular compound behaves quite differently than that described so far. A covalent network solid is a compound in which all of the atoms are connected to one another by covalent bonds. Diamond is composed entirely of carbon atoms, each bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral geometry. Melting a covalent network solid is not accomplished by overcoming the relatively weak intermolecular forces. Rather, all of the covalent bonds must be broken, a process that requires extremely high temperatures. Diamond, in fact, does not melt at all. Instead, it vaporizes to a gas at temperatures above 3500\u00b0C."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which process breaks down glucose to extract energy for cell metabolism?\nOptions:\n A. photosynthesis\nB. meiosis\nC. mitosis\nD. glycolysis","completion":"glycolysis\nExplanation: Glycolysis You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living things comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose. Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cell metabolism. Many living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of most prokaryotic and all eukaryotic cells. Glycolysis begins with the six-carbon, ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. In the first part of the glycolysis pathway, energy is used to make adjustments so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. In the second part of glycolysis, ATP and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are produced (Figure 4.13). If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose. For example, mature mammalian red blood cells are only capable of glycolysis, which is their sole source of ATP. If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells would eventually die."}

{"prompt":"Question: The uranium series is a chain constituting one what, which encompass naturally occurring isotopes of the heaviest elements?\nOptions:\n A. nuclear decay family\nB. radioactive decay family\nC. gland decay family\nD. fuel decay family","completion":"radioactive decay family\nExplanation: Radioactive Decay Series The naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of the heaviest elements fall into chains of successive disintegrations, or decays, and all the species in one chain constitute a radioactive family, or radioactive decay series. Three of these series include most of the naturally radioactive elements of the periodic table. They are the uranium series, the actinide series, and the thorium series. The neptunium series is a fourth series, which is no longer significant on the earth because of the short half-lives of the species involved. Each series is characterized by a parent (first member) that has a long half-life and a series of daughter nuclides that ultimately lead to a stable end-product\u2014that is, a nuclide on the band of stability (Figure 21.9). In all three series, the end-product is a stable isotope of lead. The neptunium series, previously thought to terminate with bismuth-209, terminates with thallium-205."}

{"prompt":"Question: Animals that do not have internal control of their body temperature are called what?\nOptions:\n A. ectotherms\nB. athermal\nC. photophores\nD. cold-blooded","completion":"ectotherms\nExplanation: Thermoregulation Animals can be divided into two groups: those that maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, and those that have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environmental temperature. Animals that do not have internal control of their body temperature are called ectotherms. The body temperature of these organisms is generally similar to the temperature of the environment, although the individual organisms may do things that keep their bodies slightly below or above the environmental temperature. This can include burrowing underground on a hot day or resting in the sunlight on a cold day. The ectotherms have been called cold-blooded, a term that may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called an endotherm. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity that an ectothermic animal cannot because they generate internal heat that keeps their cellular processes operating optimally even when the environment is cold."}

This helps prevent injury and death. Male gorillas, for example, are more likely to put on a display of aggression than to attack another male. In fact, gorillas have a whole series of display behaviors that they use to show aggression. They beat on their chest, dash back and forth, and pound the ground with their hands."}
{"prompt":"Question: In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release this?\nOptions:\n A. adrenaline\nB. salt\nC. antidiuretic hormone (adh)\nD. oxygen","completion":"antidiuretic hormone (adh)\nExplanation: Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) The solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain foods and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors. Blood osmolarity is constantly monitored by osmoreceptors\u2014specialized cells within the hypothalamus that are particularly sensitive to the concentration of sodium ions and other solutes. In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The target cells of ADH are located in the tubular cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water reabsorption. The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the blood and the less that is excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes. ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes constriction of blood vessels, which increases blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of ADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop. As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in the secretion of ADH. As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate. Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH, resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called diabetes insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration. Because little ADH is produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their fluid consumption, this doesn\u2019t effectively decrease the solute concentration in their blood because ADH levels are not high enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus."}

{"prompt":"Question: Unlike a crystalline solid, an amorphous solid is a solid that lacks a what?\nOptions:\n A. atoms\nB. weight\nC. ordered internal structure\nD. color","completion":"ordered internal structure\nExplanation: Unlike a crystalline solid, an amorphous solid is a solid that lacks an ordered internal structure. Some examples of amorphous solids include rubber, plastic, and gels. Glass is a very important amorphous solid that is made by cooling a mixture of materials in such a way that it does not crystallize. Glass is sometimes referred to as a supercooled liquid rather than a solid. If you have ever watched a glassblower in action, you have noticed that he takes advantage of the fact that amorphous solids do not have a distinct melting point like crystalline solids do. Instead, as glass is heated, it slowly softens and can be shaped into all sorts of interesting forms. When a glass object shatters, it does so in a very irregular way, unlike crystalline solids, which always break into fragments that have the same shape as dictated by its crystal system."}

Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diffuses micrometer, very tiny distance. Nervous System Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated response to the environment. Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron1 , a highly specialized cell that uses both electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons \"listen\" to sensory organs or other neurons, and can simultaneously \"hear\" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously. Likewise, a neuron can \"talk\" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle cells or glands. Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells, and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann cells that provide a myelin sheath."}

{"prompt":"Question: In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and this?\nOptions:\n A. acceleration\nB. speed\nC. direction\nD. velocity","completion":"velocity\nExplanation: In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. However, we saw in the last section that when special relativity is taken into account, massive objects have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds? Momentum is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton\u2019s second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. All of Work, Energy, and Energy Resources is devoted to momentum, and momentum has been important for many other topics as well, particularly where collisions were involved. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics. Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles. The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows. Relativistic Momentum Relativistic momentum."}

{"prompt":"Question: Many microorganisms are single celled and use what for perception and movement?\nOptions:\n A. nucleus\nB. mitochondria\nC. organelles\nD. chloroplasts","completion":"organelles\nExplanation: Chapter 12 1 MRI uses the relative amount of water in tissue to distinguish different areas, so gray and white matter in the nervous system can be seen clearly in these images. 3 Neurons enable thought, perception, and movement. Plants do not move, so they do not need this type of tissue. Microorganisms are too small to have a nervous system. Many are single-celled, and therefore have organelles for perception and movement. 5 Sodium is moving into the cell because of the immense concentration gradient, whereas potassium is moving out because of the depolarization that sodium causes. However, they both move down their respective gradients, toward equilibrium. 7 A second signal from a separate presynaptic neuron can arrive slightly later, as long as it arrives before the first one dies off, or dissipates. 9 C 11 D 13 B 15 B 17 A 19 C 21 C 23 A 25 B 27 D 29 B 31 D 33 A 34 Running on a treadmill involves contraction of the skeletal muscles in the legs, increase in contraction of the cardiac muscle of the heart, and the production and secretion of sweat in the skin to stay cool. 36 The disease would target oligodendrocytes.

{"prompt":"Question: When the hydrogen is nearly used up, the star can fuse which element into heavier elements?\nOptions:\n A. helium\nB. carbon\nC. xenon\nD. oxygen","completion":"helium\nExplanation: Within a nebula, there are varying regions where gravity has caused the gas and dust to clump together. The gravitational attraction of these clumps pull more atoms into the clump. As this accretion continues, the gas pressure increases and the core of the protostar gets hotter and hotter. If the protostar gets dense enough and hot enough, a fusion reaction will ignite and the star lights up. The minimum mass for the formation of a star is about 80 times the mass of Jupiter. A star is a very large, very hot ball of gas which has hydrogen fusing into helium in the core. Stars spend the majority of their life fusing hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen is nearly used up, the star can fuse helium into heavier elements. Throughout this process, a battle goes on in the core of the star between gravity trying to collapse the star and temperature-produced gas pressure pushing the material in the star outward. During the life of a star, there is a balance between the gas pressure pushing out and gravity pushing in."}

(b) What would its speed be relative to the Earth? 60. (a) Another airplane is flying in a jet stream that is blowing at 45.0 m\/s in a direction 20\u00ba south of east (as in Exercise 3.58). Its direction of motion relative to the Earth is 45.0\u00ba south of west, while its direction of travel relative to the air is 5.00\u00ba south of west. What is the airplane\u2019s speed relative to the air mass? (b) What is the airplane\u2019s speed relative to the Earth? 61. A sandal is dropped from the top of a 15.0-m-high mast on a ship moving at 1.75 m\/s due south. Calculate the velocity of the sandal when it hits the deck of the ship: (a) relative to the ship and (b) relative to a stationary observer on shore. (c) Discuss how the answers give a consistent result for the position at which the sandal hits the deck. The velocity of the wind relative to the water is crucial to sailboats. Suppose a sailboat is in an ocean current that has a velocity of 2.20 m\/s in a direction 30.0\u00ba east of north relative to the Earth. It encounters a wind that has a velocity of 4.50 m\/s in a direction of 50.0\u00ba south of west relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the wind relative to the water? 63. The great astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies are receding from our Milky Way Galaxy with velocities proportional to their distances. It appears to an observer on the Earth that we are at the center of an expanding universe. Figure 3.64 illustrates this for five galaxies lying along a straight line, with the Milky Way Galaxy at the center. Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities: (a) relative to galaxy 2 and (b) relative to galaxy 5. The results mean that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of expansion with the given information."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are major temperature zones primarily based on?\nOptions:\n A. altitude\nB. latitute\nC. longitude\nD. gps","completion":"latitute\nExplanation: Temperature falls from the equator to the poles. Therefore, major temperature zones are based on latitude . They include tropical, temperate, and arctic zones (see Figure below ). However, other factors besides latitude may also influence temperature. For example, land near the ocean may have cooler summers and warmer winters than land farther inland. This is because water gains and loses heat more slowly than does land, and the water temperature influences the temperature on the coast. Temperature also falls from lower to higher altitudes. That\u2019s why tropical zone mountain tops may be capped with snow."}

Although most of the intake comes through the digestive tract, about 230 mL (8 ounces) per day is generated metabolically, in the last steps of aerobic respiration. Additionally, each day about the same volume (2500 mL) of water leaves the body by different routes; most of this lost water is removed as urine. The kidneys also can adjust blood volume though mechanisms that draw water out of the filtrate and urine. The kidneys can regulate water levels in the body; they conserve water if you are dehydrated, and they can make urine more dilute to expel excess water if necessary. Water is lost through the skin through evaporation from the skin surface without overt sweating and from air expelled from the lungs. This type of water loss is called insensible water loss because a person is usually unaware of it."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of cells are gametes?\nOptions:\n A. reproductive\nB. cardiac\nC. immune\nD. proteins","completion":"reproductive\nExplanation: Sperm are male gametes, or reproductive cells.

{"prompt":"Question: During grafting, the part of the plant that is grafted is called?\nOptions:\n A. scion\nB. roots\nC. stock\nD. stem","completion":"scion\nExplanation: Artificial Methods of Asexual Reproduction These methods are frequently employed to give rise to new, and sometimes novel, plants. They include grafting, cutting, layering, and micropropagation. Grafting Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses, citrus species, and other plants. In grafting, two plant species are used; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock. The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion. Both are cut at an oblique angle (any angle other than a right angle), placed in close contact with each other, and are then held together Figure 32.26. Matching up these two surfaces as closely as possible is extremely important because these will be holding the plant together. The vascular systems of the two plants grow and fuse, forming a graft. After a period of time, the scion starts producing shoots, and eventually starts bearing flowers and fruits. Grafting is widely used in viticulture (grape growing) and the citrus industry. Scions capable of producing a particular fruit variety are grated onto root stock with specific resistance to disease."}
{"prompt":"Question: An aqueous solution is a homogeneous mixture in which the most abundant component is what?\nOptions:\n A. air\nB. oxygen\nC. water\nD. blood","completion":"water\nExplanation: An aqueous solution is a homogeneous mixture in which the most abundant component is water. The other substance(s) are typically introduced in a solid or liquid form and mixed into the water until they are evenly distributed. For example, if we placed a sample of ethanol in water and mixed it homogeneously, we would have a solution. Table salt mixed with water is another example of a solution. More generally, a solution is a homogeneous mixture. The solution component that is present in the largest amount is called the solvent , and all other substances are referred to as solutes .

{"prompt":"Question: Some sea anemones establish what kind of relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab\u2019s shell?\nOptions:\n A. pathogenic\nB. parasitic\nC. mutualistic\nD. predatory","completion":"mutualistic\nExplanation: The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. The slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore. The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. Each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. Mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange. Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab\u2019s shell. In this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. Anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts. Anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. Both gametes are produced by the polyp, which can fuse to give rise to a free-swimming planula larva. The larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp."}

Describing these changes does not address the origin of life. The two are commonly and mistakenly confused. Biological evolution likewise says nothing about cosmology, the Big Bang, or where the universe, galaxy, solar system, or Earth came from."}
{"prompt":"Question: Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of these?\nOptions:\n A. mutations\nB. habits\nC. chromosomes\nD. traits","completion":"traits\nExplanation: The generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains). Early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated markers, including those based on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. In general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population. Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RFLPs (sometimes pronounced \u201crif-lips\u201d) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual\u2019s DNA \u201cfingerprint. \u201d Certain regions of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or \u201cjunk,\u201d DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide. Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by multiple methods."}

{"prompt":"Question: The direct conversion of a solid to a gas, without an intervening liquid phase, is called what?\nOptions:\n A. amplification\nB. sublimation\nC. isolation\nD. insertion","completion":"sublimation\nExplanation: The direct conversion of a solid to a gas, without an intervening liquid phase, is calledsublimation. The amount of energy required to sublime 1 mol of a pure solid is theenthalpy of sublimation (\u0394Hsub). Common substances that sublime at standard temperature and pressure (STP; 0\u00b0C, 1 atm) include CO2 (dry ice); iodine (Figure 11.18 \"The Sublimation of Solid Iodine\"); naphthalene, a substance used to protect woolen clothing against moths; and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. As shown in Figure 11.17 \"The Three Phases of Matter and the Processes That Interconvert Them When the Temperature Is Changed\", the enthalpy of sublimation of a substance is the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization provided all values are at the same T; this is an application of Hess\u2019s law. (For more information about Hess\u2019s law, see Chapter 5 \"Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions\", Section 5.2 \"Enthalpy\"). Equation 11.3."}
{"prompt":"Question: The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) produced by what gland?\nOptions:\n A. pituitary\nB. thyroid\nC. testes\nD. adrenal","completion":"pituitary\nExplanation: 17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. The steroid hormone testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the pregnancy."}

{"prompt":"Question: Apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by what type of chemicals in plants?\nOptions:\n A. hormones\nB. pesticides\nC. enzymes\nD. photosynthesis","completion":"hormones\nExplanation: Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory. Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator, resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites. They contribute to the production of volatile compounds that attract natural enemies of predators. For example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in jasmonic acid levels, which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest. Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections. They act locally at the site of injury, and can also be transported to other tissues. Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins. Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi. Brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological processes. Signals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and GAs, amplifies their physiological effect. Apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by hormones. Root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids."}
{"prompt":"Question: When something is described as \"hydrophilic\", you can determine something about how it interacts with what?\nOptions:\n A. water\nB. hydrogen\nC. air\nD. iron","completion":"water\nExplanation: hydrophilic heads are directed outward, in contact with the water. Each micelle may contain thousands of lipid molecules. Polar lipids may also form a monolayer, a layer one molecule thick on the surface of the water. The polar heads face into water, and the nonpolar tails stick up into the air. Bilayers are double layers of lipids arranged so that the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between an inner surface and an outer surface consisting of hydrophilic heads. The hydrophilic heads are in contact with water on either side of the bilayer, whereas the tails, sequestered inside the bilayer, are prevented from having contact with the water. Bilayers like this make up every cell membrane (Figure 17.6 \"Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane\").

Deep Blood Cells","completion":"red blood cells\nExplanation: Primary Centers of the Immune System Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells). Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). The cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Cytokines stimulate these stem cells to differentiate into immune cells. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas na\u00efve T cells transit from the bone marrow to the thymus for maturation. In the thymus, immature T cells that express TCRs complementary to self-antigens are destroyed. This process helps prevent autoimmune responses. On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as illustrated in Figure 42.20, house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens."}
{"prompt":"Question: What structures sweep laterally, hugging the pelvic walls, then turn medially and pierce the bladder wall obliquely?\nOptions:\n A. ureters\nB. tubules\nC. fallopian tube\nD. catheters","completion":"ureters\nExplanation: Ureters The kidneys and ureters are completely retroperitoneal, and the bladder has a peritoneal covering only over the dome. As urine is formed, it drains into the calyces of the kidney, which merge to form the funnel-shaped renal pelvis in the hilum of each kidney. The hilum narrows to become the ureter of each kidney. As urine passes through the ureter, it does not passively drain into the bladder but rather is propelled by waves of peristalsis. As the ureters enter the pelvis, they sweep laterally, hugging the pelvic walls. As they approach the bladder, they turn medially and pierce the bladder wall obliquely. This is important because it creates an one-way valve (a physiological sphincter rather than an anatomical sphincter) that allows urine into the bladder but prevents reflux of urine from the bladder back into the ureter. Children born lacking this oblique course of the ureter through the bladder wall are susceptible to \u201cvesicoureteral reflux,\u201d which dramatically increases their risk of serious UTI. Pregnancy also increases the likelihood of reflux and UTI. The ureters are approximately 30 cm long. The inner mucosa is lined with transitional epithelium (Figure 25.6) and scattered goblet cells that secrete protective mucus. The muscular layer of the ureter consists of longitudinal and circular smooth muscles that create the peristaltic contractions to move the urine into the bladder without the aid of gravity. Finally, a loose adventitial layer composed of collagen and fat anchors the ureters between the parietal peritoneum and the posterior abdominal wall."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of reproduction is vegetative reproduction?\nOptions:\n A. sexual\nB. asexual\nC. meiosis\nD. mitosis","completion":"asexual\nExplanation: Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants. This type of reproduction occurs when new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores. The formation of new plants out of rhizomes or stolons is an example of vegetative reproductive, such as in the strawberry plant. Other plants use this type of reproduction to reproduce through bulbs or tubers, or shoots and suckers that form along lateral roots. See the Plant Biology concepts for additional information."}
{"prompt":"Question: Within a group, the ionization energy decreases as the size of the atom gets what?\nOptions:\n A. brighter\nB. larger\nC. smaller\nD. lighter","completion":"larger\nExplanation: Within a group, the ionization energy decreases as the size of the atom gets larger. On the graph, we see that the ionization energy increases as we go up the group to smaller atoms. In this situation, the first electron removed is farther from the nucleus as the atomic number (number of protons) increases. Being farther away from the positive attraction makes it easier for that electron to be pulled off."}

{"prompt":"Question: In mammals what does the zona pellucida protect?\nOptions:\n A. testes\nB. sperm\nC. egg\nD. fetus","completion":"egg\nExplanation: Fertilization Fertilization, pictured in Figure 43.23a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote. The egg and sperm each contain one set of chromosomes. To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma."}

{"prompt":"Question: Cations are attracted to anions, which are ions with what charge?\nOptions:\n A. similar\nB. neutral\nC. negative\nD. positive","completion":"negative\nExplanation: 2.2 Chemical Bonds Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and the other elements of the human body are making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions are charged atoms that form when an atom donates or accepts one or more negatively charged electrons. Cations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is called an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar covalent bonds have \u201cpoles\u201d\u2014regions of weakly positive and negative charge\u2014and have a triangular three-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of polar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen atoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to anions or electronegative regions of other polar molecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules, resulting in the properties of water that are important to living things."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do erythrocytes carry and deliver to tissues in the body?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. Helium\nC. carbon\nD. oxide","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the same size in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 \u00b5l, a dog is close at 7.0 \u00b5l, but a cat\u2019s RBC diameter is 5.9 \u00b5l. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 \u00b5l. Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish, amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell\u2019s life. The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues. Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per \u00b5l, dogs from 5,600 to 19,200 cells per \u00b5l, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per \u00b5l, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per \u00b5l, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000 cells per \u00b5l. Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to."}
{"prompt":"Question: Virtually all of the effects of pregnancy can be attributed in some way to the influence of what?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. hormones\nC. enzymes\nD. acids","completion":"hormones\nExplanation: Effects of Hormones Virtually all of the effects of pregnancy can be attributed in some way to the influence of hormones\u2014particularly estrogens, progesterone, and hCG. During weeks 7\u201312 from the LMP, the pregnancy hormones are primarily generated by the corpus luteum. Progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum stimulates the production of decidual cells of the endometrium that nourish the blastocyst before placentation. As the placenta develops and the corpus luteum degenerates during weeks 12\u201317, the placenta gradually takes over as the endocrine organ of pregnancy. The placenta converts weak androgens secreted by the maternal and fetal adrenal glands to estrogens, which are necessary for pregnancy to progress. Estrogen levels climb throughout the pregnancy, increasing 30-fold by childbirth. Estrogens have the following actions: \u2022 They suppress FSH and LH production, effectively preventing ovulation. (This function is the biological basis of hormonal birth control pills. ) \u2022 They induce the growth of fetal tissues and are necessary for the maturation of the fetal lungs and liver. \u2022 They promote fetal viability by regulating progesterone production and triggering fetal synthesis of cortisol, which helps with the maturation of the lungs, liver, and endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland and adrenal gland. \u2022 They stimulate maternal tissue growth, leading to uterine enlargement and mammary duct expansion and branching. Relaxin, another hormone secreted by the corpus luteum and then by the placenta, helps prepare the mother\u2019s body for childbirth. It increases the elasticity of the symphysis pubis joint and pelvic ligaments, making room for the growing fetus and allowing expansion of the pelvic outlet for childbirth. Relaxin also helps dilate the cervix during labor."}
{"prompt":"Question: Thomson\u2019s plum pudding model shows the structure of what?\nOptions:\n A. nucleus\nB. cell\nC. atom\nD. DNA","completion":"atom\nExplanation: Following the discovery of the electron, J. J. Thomson developed what became known as the \u201c plum pudding \u201d model in 1904. Plum pudding is an English dessert similar to a blueberry muffin. In Thomson\u2019s plum pudding model of the atom, the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge like blueberries stuck into a muffin. The positive matter was thought to be jelly- like or a thick soup. The electrons were somewhat mobile. As they got closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative charges and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom."}
{"prompt":"Question: What begins when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis?\nOptions:\n A. germination\nB. morphogenesis\nC. oogenesis\nD. gametogenesis","completion":"oogenesis\nExplanation: Oogenesis begins long before birth when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis. It produces a diploid daughter cell called a primary oocyte. The primary oocyte, in turn, starts to go through the first cell division of meiosis (meiosis I). However, it does not complete meiosis until much later. The primary oocyte remains in a resting state, nestled in a tiny, immature follicle until puberty."}

Vertebrates have one of three reproductive strategies, known as ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary."}
{"prompt":"Question: Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by which cells?\nOptions:\n A. interferons\nB. leukocytes\nC. platelets\nD. phagocytic","completion":"phagocytic\nExplanation: Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies. Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies is called opsonization. In a process called complement fixation, IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind. The combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens. Affinity, Avidity, and Cross Reactivity Not all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability. In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities (attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in Figure 42.25. An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen."}

This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds important for the body\u2019s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic. \u2022 An inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples. \u2022 An organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are synthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and hydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two elements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the chemicals that fuel your functioning.

{"prompt":"Question: In mammals, the cells on the exterior form the trophectoderm, which goes on to form what?\nOptions:\n A. protoplanetary tissues\nB. extraembryonic tissues\nC. aeroponics tissues\nD. cardiac tissues","completion":"extraembryonic tissues\nExplanation: organism\u2019s life cycle is as subject to the effects of evolutionary pressures as any other (although it is easy to concentrate our attentions on adult forms and behaviors). The study of these processes, known as embryology, is beyond our scope here, but we can outline a few common themes. If fertilized eggs develop outside of the body of the mother and without parental protection, these new organisms are highly vulnerable to predation. In such organisms, early embryonic development generally proceeds rapidly. The eggs are large and contain all of the nutrients required for development to proceed up to the point where the new organism can feed on its own. To facilitate such rapid development, the egg is essentially pre-organized, that is, it is highly asymmetric, with specific factors that can influence gene expression, either directly or indirectly, positioned in various regions of the egg (\u2192). Entry of the sperm (the male gamete), which itself is an inherently asymmetric process, can also lead to reorganization of the cytoplasm (SEP marks sperm entry point in the figure early frog development). Maternal and fertilization-driven asymmetries are stabilized by the rapid cycles of DNA replication and cell division, with growth being dependent upon the utilization of maternally supplied nutrients. As distinct cells are formed, they begin to become different from one another as i) they inherit different determinants, ii) the presence of these determinants leads to changes in gene expression, and iii) cells secrete and respond to different factors that drive their differentiation further into different cell types, with different behaviors based on differences in gene expression. On the other hand, in a number of organisms, and specifically mammals, embryonic development occurs within the mother, so there is no compelling need to stockpile nutrients within the egg and the rate of development is (generally) dramatically slower. In such developmental systems, it is not the asymmetries associated with the oocyte and fertilized egg that are critical, but rather the asymmetries that arise during embryonic development. As the zygote divides, a major factor that drives the differentiation is whether a cell comes to lie on the surface of the embryo or within the interior (\u2192). In mammals, the cells on the exterior form the trophectoderm, which goes on to form extraembryonic tissues, in particular the membranous tissues that surround the embryo and become part of the placenta, the interface between the embryo and the mother. Cells within the interior form the inner cell mass that produces to the embryo proper. Changes in gene expression will lead to changes in the ability to produce and respond to inductive signals, which will in turn influence cell behavior and gene expression. Through this process, the cells of the inner cell mass come to form the various tissues and organs of the organism; that is, skin, muscle, nerve, hair, bone, blood, etc. It is easy to tell a muscle cell from a neuron from a bone cell from a skin cell by the set of genes they express, the proteins they contain, their shapes (morphology), their internal organization, and their behaviors. biofundamentals \u2013 coreBIO."}

{"prompt":"Question: Use of oil-consuming bacteria to clean up an oil spill is an example of what?\nOptions:\n A. generation\nB. bioremediation\nC. coagulation\nD. biodegradation","completion":"bioremediation\nExplanation: Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater. Certain toxic metals, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. The reduction of \u2212 \u2212 SeO 24 to SeO 23 and to Se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. Mercury is an active ingredient of some pesticides; it is used in industry and is also a byproduct of certain industries, such as battery production. Mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg2+ to Hg0, which is nontoxic to humans. Probably one of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 13.10), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006,) and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by adding inorganic nutrients that help bacteria already present in the environment to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on the hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking them into inorganic compounds. Some species, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, while other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within 1 year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time. Researchers have genetically engineered other bacteria to consume petroleum products; indeed, the first patent application for a bioremediation application in the U. was for a genetically modified oileating bacterium."}

{"prompt":"Question: The body contains how many types of muscle tissue?\nOptions:\n A. two\nB. seven\nC. three\nD. four","completion":"three\nExplanation: 38.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation\u2013contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces."}

{"prompt":"Question: What heisenberg principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science?\nOptions:\n A. uncertainty principle\nB. impossibility principle\nC. vacuum principle\nD. certainty principle","completion":"uncertainty principle\nExplanation: The value of \u0127 is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant. It should be noted that Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for the transition are similarly related, as \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u210f . As will be discussed later, even the vector components of angular 2 momentum cannot all be specified exactly simultaneously. Heisenberg\u2019s principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of wave\u2013particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly. Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are limited in their precision. In the realm of quantum mechanics, measurements introduce changes into the system that is being observed."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where does most of the earth's energy come from?\nOptions:\n A. magnetic field\nB. its core\nC. sun\nD. its atmosphere","completion":"sun\nExplanation: Give an example of how matter cycles. While matter cycles round and round in the Earth System, ENERGY FLOWS through the Earth System. The vast majority of Earth\u2019s energy comes from the sun, flows into the Earth\u2019s System, and flows out of the Earth\u2019s System into space. If all the energy that comes to Earth from the sun were to stay on Earth, the Earth would melt away. But the energy that comes to Earth from the sun does not stay. Eventually it radiates back out to space as heat. We know this because the average temperature of the Earth has remained relatively constant. If the energy from the sun were to stay on Earth, the Earth\u2019s average temperature would rise. Some of the sun\u2019s energy is reflected by the atmosphere, some is absorbed by the Earth and re-radiated as heat, some evaporates water and powers the water cycle, some is captured by plants and used to make sugars, and some powers the wind but eventually ALL of the energy that comes to the Earth from the sun leaves the Earth and flows into space. For this reason we say that energy flows through the Earth System."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a cross in which the inheritance of two characteristics are tracked at the same time?\nOptions:\n A. fraternal\nB. identical twin\nC. Mendelian\nD. dihybrid cross","completion":"dihybrid cross\nExplanation: After Mendel's first set of experiments, Mendel wanted to see if the inheritance of characteristics were dependent, or were they independent events. Mendel asked if the segregation of the heritable factors (allele) for one characteristic (gene) had any effect of the segregation of the factors for another characteristic. For example, did the segregation of the flower color factors have any effect on the segregation of the seed shape factors? So Mendel performed crosses in which he followed the segregation of two genes. Mendel crossed pea plants that differed in two characteristics, such as seed color and shape. A dihybrid cross is a cross in which the inheritance of two characteristics are tracked at the same time. The offspring of such a cross are called dihybrids ."}

{"prompt":"Question: Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to earth\u2019s surface by what force?\nOptions:\n A. weight\nB. light\nC. gravity\nD. traction","completion":"gravity\nExplanation: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth\u2019s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health."}

This process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis. Oncogenes are mutated genes involved in the development of cancer."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the functional unit of the kidney which actively filters blood and generates urine?\nOptions:\n A. sechron\nB. nephron\nC. epithelial\nD. mecrophron","completion":"nephron\nExplanation: 41.2 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regions\u2014the cortex, medulla, and pelvis. The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.

{"prompt":"Question: In vertebrates, what tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure?\nOptions:\n A. bone\nB. cartilage\nC. blood\nD. collagen","completion":"bone\nExplanation: Complex Tissue Structure As multicellular organisms, animals differ from plants and fungi because their cells don\u2019t have cell walls, their cells may be embedded in an extracellular matrix (such as bone, skin, or connective tissue), and their cells have unique structures for intercellular communication (such as gap junctions). In addition, animals possess unique tissues, absent in fungi and plants, which allow coordination (nerve tissue) of motility (muscle tissue). Animals are also characterized by specialized connective tissues that provide structural support for cells and organs. This connective tissue constitutes the extracellular surroundings of cells and is made up of organic and inorganic materials. In vertebrates, bone tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure. The complex bodies and activities of vertebrates demand such supportive tissues. Epithelial tissues cover, line, protect, and secrete. Epithelial tissues include the epidermis of the integument, the lining of the digestive tract and trachea, and make up the ducts of the liver and glands of advanced animals. The animal kingdom is divided into Parazoa (sponges) and Eumetazoa (all other animals). As very simple animals, the organisms in group Parazoa (\u201cbeside animal\u201d) do not contain true specialized tissues; although they do possess specialized cells that perform different functions, those cells are not organized into tissues. These organisms are considered animals since they lack the ability to make their own food. Animals with true tissues are in the group Eumetazoa (\u201ctrue animals\u201d). When we think of animals, we usually think of Eumetazoans, since most animals fall into this category. The different types of tissues in true animals are responsible for carrying out specific functions for the organism. This differentiation and specialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity. For example, the evolution of nerve tissues and muscle tissues has resulted in animals\u2019 unique ability to rapidly sense and respond to changes."}

{"prompt":"Question: The atoms of a compound are held together by what type of bonds?\nOptions:\n A. covalent\nB. chemical\nC. mineral\nD. radiation","completion":"chemical\nExplanation: The atoms of a compound are held together by chemical bonds. Chemical bonds form when atoms share electrons. There are different types of chemical bonds, and they vary in how strongly they hold together the atoms of a compound. Two of the strongest types of bonds are covalent and ionic bonds. Covalent bonds form between atoms that have little if any difference in electronegativity, and result when atoms share electrons. Electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract electrons toward itself. Ionic bonds , in contrast, form between atoms that are significantly different in electronegativity. An ion is an atom that has gained or lost at least one electron. Ionic bonds form between ions of opposite charges."}

{"prompt":"Question: What element is responsible for one-half of the osmotic pressure gradient that exists between the interior of cells and their surrounding environment?\nOptions:\n A. sodium\nB. calcium\nC. potassium\nD. nitrogen","completion":"sodium\nExplanation: Sodium Sodium is the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It is responsible for one-half of the osmotic pressure gradient that exists between the interior of cells and their surrounding environment. People eating a typical Western diet, which is very high in NaCl, routinely take in 130 to 160 mmol\/day of sodium, but humans require only 1 to 2 mmol\/day. This excess sodium appears to be a major factor in hypertension (high blood pressure) in some people. Excretion of sodium is accomplished primarily by the kidneys. Sodium is freely filtered through the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys, and although much of the filtered sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, some remains in the filtrate and urine, and is normally excreted. Hyponatremia is a lower-than-normal concentration of sodium, usually associated with excess water accumulation in the body, which dilutes the sodium. An absolute loss of sodium may be due to a decreased intake of the ion coupled with its continual excretion in the urine. An abnormal loss of sodium from the body can result from several conditions, including excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea; the use of diuretics; excessive production of urine, which can occur in diabetes; and acidosis, either metabolic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. A relative decrease in blood sodium can occur because of an imbalance of sodium in one of the body\u2019s other fluid compartments, like IF, or from a dilution of sodium due to water retention related to edema or congestive heart failure. At the cellular level, hyponatremia results in increased entry of water into cells by osmosis, because the concentration of solutes within the cell exceeds the concentration of solutes in the now-diluted ECF. The excess water causes swelling of the cells; the swelling of red blood cells\u2014decreasing their oxygen-carrying efficiency and making them potentially too large to fit through capillaries\u2014along with the swelling of neurons in the brain can result in brain damage or even death. Hypernatremia is an abnormal increase of blood sodium. It can result from water loss from the blood, resulting in the hemoconcentration of all blood constituents. Hormonal imbalances involving ADH and aldosterone may also result in higher-than-normal sodium values."}
{"prompt":"Question: The flood of sodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows what to move through the symporter and into the cell?\nOptions:\n A. insulin\nB. sucrose\nC. glucose\nD. mitochondria","completion":"glucose\nExplanation: Active transport pumps can also work together with other active or passive transport systems to move substances across the membrane. For example, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a high concentration of sodium ions outside of the cell. Therefore, if the cell needs sodium ions, all it has to do is open a passive sodium channel, as the concentration gradient of the sodium ions will drive them to diffuse into the cell. In this way, the action of an active transport pump (the sodiumpotassium pump) powers the passive transport of sodium ions by creating a concentration gradient. When active transport powers the transport of another substance in this way, it is called secondary active transport. Symporters are secondary active transporters that move two substances in the same direction. For example, the sodiumglucose symporter uses sodium ions to \u201cpull\u201d glucose molecules into the cell. Because cells store glucose for energy, glucose is typically at a higher concentration inside of the cell than outside. However, due to the action of the sodiumpotassium pump, sodium ions will easily diffuse into the cell when the symporter is opened. The flood of sodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows glucose to move through the symporter and into the cell, against its concentration gradient."}

{"prompt":"Question: Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down these?\nOptions:\n A. carbohydrate molecules\nB. lipid molecules\nC. protein molecules\nD. oxygen molecules","completion":"carbohydrate molecules\nExplanation: The Energy Cycle Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules. But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a \u201cwaste product\u201d (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism\u2014either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce \u201cwaste\u201d in the form of CO2 gas. In nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and over infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never disappear (Figure 8.20). CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun."}

The two kidneys receive about 25 percent of cardiac output. They are protected in the retroperitoneal space by the renal fat pad and overlying ribs and muscle. Ureters, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves enter and leave at the renal hilum. The renal arteries arise directly from the aorta, and the renal veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava. Kidney function is derived from the actions of about 1.3 million nephrons per kidney; these are the \u201cfunctional units. \u201d A capillary bed, the glomerulus, filters blood and the filtrate is captured by Bowman\u2019s capsule. A portal system is formed when the blood flows through a second capillary bed surrounding the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and the loop of Henle. Most water and solutes are recovered by this second capillary bed. This filtrate is processed and finally gathered by collecting ducts that drain into the minor calyces, which merge to form major calyces; the filtrate then proceeds to the renal pelvis and finally the ureters."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the pattern of lines formed when light passes through a prism to separate it into the different frequencies of light it contains?\nOptions:\n A. prismatic rainbow\nB. kaleidoscope effect\nC. light emission spectrum\nD. atomic emission spectrum","completion":"atomic emission spectrum\nExplanation: Scientists studied the distinctive pink color of the gas discharge created by hydrogen gas. When a narrow beam of this light was viewed through a prism, the light was separated into four lines of very specific wavelengths (and frequencies since and are inversely related). An atomic emission spectrum is the pattern of lines formed when light passes through a prism to separate it into the different frequencies of light it contains. The Figure below shows the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen."}
{"prompt":"Question: A wave is the transfer of energy through what else?\nOptions:\n A. liquid\nB. matter\nC. air\nD. gas","completion":"matter\nExplanation: Most ocean waves are caused by winds. A wave is the transfer of energy through matter. A wave that travels across miles of ocean is traveling energy, not water. Ocean waves transfer energy from wind to the water. The energy is transferred from one water molecule to the next. The energy of a wave may travel for thousands of miles. The water itself moves very little. The picture below shows how water molecules move when a wave goes by ( Figure below ). Once the wave starts, it doesn't need more wind to keep it going."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is it called when waves interact with other waves?\nOptions:\n A. wave interference\nB. combination interference\nC. wave impact\nD. wave collision","completion":"wave interference\nExplanation: Waves interact not only with matter in the ways described above. Waves also interact with other waves. This is called wave interference . Wave interference may occur when two waves that are traveling in opposite directions meet. The two waves pass through each other, and this affects their amplitude. How amplitude is affected depends on the type of interference. Interference can be constructive or destructive."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the study of heredity called?\nOptions:\n A. geriatrics\nB. heretics\nC. genetics\nD. pediatrics","completion":"genetics\nExplanation: Introduction Genetics is the study of heredity. Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood. Mendel selected a simple biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using large sample sizes. Because of Mendel\u2019s work, the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed. We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel\u2019s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance."}

{"prompt":"Question: What elements have the highest attraction for electrons?\nOptions:\n A. nonmetals\nB. gases\nC. metals\nD. carbons","completion":"nonmetals\nExplanation: Nonmetals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions and have a high attraction for electrons within a compound. The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Since the noble gases are a special group because of their lack of reactivity, the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. It is not found in nature as a free element. Fluorine gas reacts explosively with many other elements and compounds and is considered to be one of the most dangerous known substances."}

{"prompt":"Question: Studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited amounts of this?\nOptions:\n A. dna\nB. eggs\nC. chromosomes\nD. sperm","completion":"sperm\nExplanation: Energy Budgets, Reproductive Costs, and Sexual Selection in Drosophila Research into how animals allocate their energy resources for growth, maintenance, and reproduction has used a variety of experimental animal models. Some of this work has been done using the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited sperm remaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at reproduction by selecting optimal mates. In a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The males that mated with virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number of inseminated females with which they were unable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large (indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not mate lived longer, allowing them more opportunities to find mates in the future. More recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and [3] how this is affected by previous matings (Figure 45.8). Males were allowed to select between smaller and larger females. Findings showed that larger females had greater fecundity, producing twice as many offspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had previously mated, and thus had lower supplies of sperm, were termed \u201cresource-depleted,\u201d while males that had not mated were termed \u201cnonresource-depleted. \u201d The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with larger females, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus, males with depleted sperm supplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before they replenished their sperm supply, selected larger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances for offspring. This study was one of the first to show that the physiological state of the male affected its mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive resources."}
{"prompt":"Question: What determines the strength of a base when dissolved in water?\nOptions:\n A. amount of phosphorus ions produced\nB. amount of hydroxide ions produced\nC. pH level\nD. saline content","completion":"amount of hydroxide ions produced\nExplanation: The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), a base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water."}

{"prompt":"Question: What occurs when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass?\nOptions:\n A. a cold front\nB. an occluded front\nC. a stationary front\nD. a snow day","completion":"a cold front\nExplanation: A cold front occurs when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass. This is shown in Figure below . The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass and lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front."}

{"prompt":"Question: How does the atomic number change during beta emission?\nOptions:\n A. stays the same\nB. increases by two\nC. decreases by one\nD. increases by one","completion":"increases by one\nExplanation: Beta (\u03b2) decay is a more complicated process. Unlike the \u03b1-emission, which simply expels a particle, the \u03b2-emission involves the transformation of a neutron in the nucleus to a proton and an electron. The electron is then ejected from the nucleus. In the process, the atomic number increases by one while the atomic weight stays the same. As is the case with \u03b1-emissions, \u03b2-emissions are often accompanied by \u03b3-radiation."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do waves travel faster through solids?\nOptions:\n A. particles fuse together\nB. particles range together\nC. particles pipe together\nD. particles closer together","completion":"particles closer together\nExplanation: The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which the waves are traveling. Generally, waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases. That\u2019s because particles are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases. When particles are farther apart, it takes longer for the energy of the disturbance to pass from particle to particle through the medium. At the following URL, you can watch an animation showing what happens when a wave passes from one medium to another."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of bond generally forms between a metal and non-metal?\nOptions:\n A. soluble\nB. ionic\nC. unbreakable\nD. horizontal","completion":"ionic\nExplanation: Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That\u2019s because metals \u201cwant\u201d to give up electrons, and nonmetals \u201cwant\u201d to gain electrons. Find sodium (Na) in the Figure below . Sodium is an alkali metal in group 1. Like all group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron. If sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Now find fluorine (F) in the periodic table Figure below . Fluorine is a halogen in group 17. Like all group 17 elements, fluorine has seven valence electrons. If fluorine gains one electron, it will also have a full outer energy level and the most stable arrangement of electrons."}

{"prompt":"Question: When using a microscope we do not see the entire extent of the sample. depending on the eyepiece and objective lens we see a restricted region which we say is this?\nOptions:\n A. tunnel vision\nB. focal point\nC. field of view\nD. peripheral view","completion":"field of view\nExplanation: When using a microscope we do not see the entire extent of the sample. Depending on the eyepiece and objective lens we see a restricted region which we say is the field of view. The objective is then manipulated in two-dimensions above the sample to view other regions of the sample. Electronic scanning of either the objective or the sample is used in scanning microscopy. The image formed at each point during the scanning is combined using a computer to generate an image of a larger region of the sample at a selected magnification. When using a microscope, we rely on gathering light to form an image. Hence most specimens need to be illuminated, particularly at higher magnifications, when observing details that are so small that they reflect only small amounts of light. To make such objects easily visible, the intensity of light falling on them needs to be increased. Special illuminating systems called condensers are used for this purpose. The type of condenser that is suitable for an application depends on how the specimen is examined, whether by transmission, scattering or reflecting. See Figure 26.20 for an example of each. White light sources are common and lasers are often used. Laser light illumination tends to be quite intense and it is important to ensure that the light does not result in the degradation of the specimen."}

In medicine, mass spectrometers are used to measure the concentration of isotopes used as tracers. Usually, biological molecules such as proteins are very large, so they are broken down into smaller fragments before analyzing. Recently, large virus particles have been analyzed as a whole on mass spectrometers. Sometimes a gas chromatograph or high-performance liquid chromatograph provides an initial separation of the large molecules, which are then input into the mass spectrometer."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of compounds contain positively and negatively charged ions in a ratio that results in an overall charge of zero?\nOptions:\n A. neutral compounds\nB. zero charged compunds\nC. zeronic ions\nD. ionic compounds","completion":"ionic compounds\nExplanation: Summary The atoms in chemical compounds are held together by attractive electrostatic interactions known as chemical bonds. Ionic compounds contain positively and negatively charged ions in a ratio that results in an overall charge of zero. The ions are held together in a regular spatial arrangement by electrostatic forces. Mostcovalent compounds consist of molecules, groups of atoms in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared by at least two atoms to form a covalent bond. The atoms in molecules are held together by the electrostatic attractionbetween the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and the negatively charged electrons shared by the nuclei. The molecular formula of a covalent compound gives the types and numbers of atoms present. Compounds that contain predominantly carbon and hydrogen are called organic compounds, whereas compounds that consist primarily of elements other than carbon and hydrogen areinorganic compounds. Diatomic molecules contain two atoms, andpolyatomic molecules contain more than two. A structural formula indicates the composition and approximate structure and shape of a molecule. Single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds are covalent bonds in which one, two, and three pairs of electrons, respectively, are shared between two Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: People with which skin type run a greater risk of vitamin d deficiency?\nOptions:\n A. darker skin\nB. lighter skin\nC. brighter skin\nD. weaker skin","completion":"darker skin\nExplanation: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency."}

{"prompt":"Question: What begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo?\nOptions:\n A. calcification\nB. elongation\nC. ossification\nD. incubation","completion":"ossification\nExplanation: Development of Bone Ossification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair."}

{"prompt":"Question: Water follows where sodium ions lead, due to what process?\nOptions:\n A. electrolysis\nB. absorption\nC. osmosis\nD. hydration","completion":"osmosis\nExplanation: Blood Pressure Regulation Due to osmosis, water follows where Na+ leads. Much of the water the kidneys recover from the forming urine follows the reabsorption of Na+. ADH stimulation of aquaporin channels allows for regulation of water recovery in the collecting ducts. Normally, all of the glucose is recovered, but loss of glucose control (diabetes mellitus) may result in an osmotic dieresis severe enough to produce severe dehydration and death. A loss of renal function means a loss of effective vascular volume control, leading to hypotension (low blood pressure) or hypertension (high blood pressure), which can lead to stroke, heart attack, and aneurysm formation. The kidneys cooperate with the lungs, liver, and adrenal cortex through the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (see Figure 25.14). The liver synthesizes and secretes the inactive precursor angiotensinogen. When the blood pressure is low, the kidney synthesizes and releases renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, and ACE produced in the lung converts angiotensin I into biologically active angiotensin II (Figure 25.23). The immediate and short-term effect of angiotensin II is to raise blood pressure by causing widespread vasoconstriction. angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal."}

{"prompt":"Question: Distinct from a suspension, a solution is considered what type of mixture?\nOptions:\n A. homogeneous\nB. gaseous\nC. continuous\nD. heterogeneous","completion":"homogeneous\nExplanation: As a child, you may have made suspensions such as mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water, known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the other hand, when we make a solution, we prepare a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. A group of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate between those of suspensions and solutions (Figure 11.30). The particles in a colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small enough that they do not settle out upon standing."}

Raw eggs and undercooked meats commonly carry the bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning can be prevented by cooking meat thoroughly and washing surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat. Washing your hands before and after handling food also helps prevent contamination."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines and treat and study conditions ranging from allergies to aids?\nOptions:\n A. endocrinologists\nB. immunologists\nC. vaccinologists\nD. virologists","completion":"immunologists\nExplanation: Immunologist The variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cell\u2019s recognition sites are of prime interest in immunology. These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. Many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of vaccines. Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a person\u2019s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person\u2019s environment on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. In the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer was not at all understood. To work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists undertake at least 2\u20133 years of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology. Immunologists must possess knowledge of the functions of the human body as they relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of pharmacology and medical technology, such as medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical procedures."}

{"prompt":"Question: The thick tunica media allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in what?\nOptions:\n A. inhibition\nB. vasodilation\nC. accumulation\nD. vasoconstriction","completion":"vasoconstriction\nExplanation: Farther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the percentage of elastic fibers in an artery\u2019s tunica intima decreases and the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases. The artery at this point is described as a muscular artery. The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm. Their thick tunica media allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased quantity of elastic fibers limits their ability to expand. Fortunately, because the blood pressure has eased by the time it reaches these more distant vessels, elasticity has become less important. Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no \u201cline of demarcation\u201d where an elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular. Rather, there is a gradual transition as the vascular tree repeatedly branches. In turn, muscular arteries branch to distribute blood to the vast network of arterioles. For this reason, a muscular artery is also known as a distributing artery."}

{"prompt":"Question: In classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with what?\nOptions:\n A. unconditioned stimulus\nB. external inhibition\nC. blocking effect\nD. conditioned stimulus","completion":"conditioned stimulus\nExplanation: Conditioned Behavior Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence. During operant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or frequency. Classical Conditioning In classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with, the conditioned stimulus. The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response. The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs (Figure 45.40). In Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of seeing or smelling their food. The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned response was the ringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. This was repeated during several trials. After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond by salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung, even when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus and the salivation became the conditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned and conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic differences when compared to the unconditioned dog."}

{"prompt":"Question: The primary function of insulin is to facilitate the uptake of what into body cells?\nOptions:\n A. sucralose\nB. water\nC. chloride\nD. glucose","completion":"glucose\nExplanation: Insulin The primary function of insulin is to facilitate the uptake of glucose into body cells. Red blood cells, as well as cells of the brain, liver, kidneys, and the lining of the small intestine, do not have insulin receptors on their cell membranes and do not require insulin for glucose uptake. Although all other body cells do require insulin if they are to take glucose from the bloodstream, skeletal muscle cells and adipose cells are the primary targets of insulin. The presence of food in the intestine triggers the release of gastrointestinal tract hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (previously known as gastric inhibitory peptide). This is in turn the initial trigger for insulin production and secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas. Once nutrient absorption occurs, the resulting surge in blood glucose levels further stimulates insulin secretion. Precisely how insulin facilitates glucose uptake is not entirely clear. However, insulin appears to activate a tyrosine kinase receptor, triggering the phosphorylation of many substrates within the cell. These multiple biochemical reactions converge to support the movement of intracellular vesicles containing facilitative glucose transporters to the cell membrane. In the absence of insulin, these transport proteins are normally recycled slowly between the cell membrane and cell interior. Insulin triggers the rapid movement of a pool of glucose transporter vesicles to the cell membrane, where they fuse and expose the glucose transporters to the extracellular fluid. The transporters then move glucose by facilitated diffusion into the cell interior."}
{"prompt":"Question: What process brings nutrients from the ocean's floor to its surface?\nOptions:\n A. Down welling\nB. coastal swell\nC. upwelling\nD.

{"prompt":"Question: Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in what?\nOptions:\n A. resonant motion\nB. kinetic motion\nC. harmonic motion\nD. homeostasis","completion":"harmonic motion\nExplanation: Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in harmonic motion. Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact with the initial source. Since waves are disturbances in an existing medium, they are considered phenomena and not actual objects."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is pedocal soil commonly found?\nOptions:\n A. deserts\nB. grasslands\nC. forests\nD. slopes","completion":"grasslands\nExplanation: Pedocal is the soil common in grasslands. The more arid climate increases calcium in the soil. Pedocal is not as fertile."}
{"prompt":"Question: Carbon is a nonmetal with a significantly higher electronegativity; it is therefore more likely to accept electrons in what kind of reaction?\nOptions:\n A. reversable reaction\nB. redox reaction\nC. catalyst reaction\nD. isotope reaction","completion":"redox reaction\nExplanation: a reductant or an oxidant; it is also a Lewis base. The other reactant (Cl2) is an oxidant, so we expect a redox reaction to occur in which the carbon of CO is further oxidized. Because Cl2 is a two-electron oxidant and the carbon atom of CO can be oxidized by two electrons to the +4 oxidation state, the product is phosgene (Cl2C=O). Unlike Cl2, BF3 is not a good oxidant, even though it contains boron in its highest oxidation state (+3). Nor can BF3 behave like a reductant. Like any other species with only six valence electrons, however, it is certainly a Lewis acid. Hence an acid\u2013base reaction is the most likely alternative, especially because we know that CO can use the lone pair of electrons on carbon to act as a Lewis base. The most probable reaction is therefore the formation of a Lewis acid\u2013base adduct. Typically, both reactants behave like reductants. Unless one of them can also behave like an oxidant, no reaction will occur. We know that Sr is an active metal because it lies far to the left in the periodic table and that it is more electropositive than carbon. Carbon is a nonmetal with a significantly higher electronegativity; it is therefore more likely to accept electrons in a redox reaction. We conclude, therefore, that Sr will be oxidized, and C will be reduced. Carbon forms ionic carbides with active metals, so the reaction will produce a species formally containing either C4\u2212 or C22\u2212. Those that contain C4\u2212 usually involve small, highly charged metal ions, so Sr2+ will produce the acetylide (SrC2) instead. Exercise."}

{"prompt":"Question: At the time of birth, bones of the brain case are separated by what wide areas of fibrous connective tissue, which later become sutures?\nOptions:\n A. fluctuations\nB. fontanelles\nC. cerebellum\nD. sporozoans","completion":"fontanelles\nExplanation: 7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton Formation of the axial skeleton begins during early embryonic development with the appearance of the rod-like notochord along the dorsal length of the early embryo. Repeating, paired blocks of tissue called somites then appear along either side of notochord. As the somites grow, they split into parts, one of which is called a sclerotome. This consists of mesenchyme, the embryonic tissue that will become the bones, cartilages, and connective tissues of the body. Mesenchyme in the head region will produce the bones of the skull via two different mechanisms. The bones of the brain case arise via intramembranous ossification in which embryonic mesenchyme tissue converts directly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are separated by fontanelles, wide areas of fibrous connective tissue. As the bones grow, the fontanelles are reduced to sutures, which allow for continued growth of the skull throughout childhood. In contrast, the cranial base and facial bones are produced by the process of endochondral ossification, in which mesenchyme tissue initially produces a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage model allows for growth of the bone and is gradually converted into bone over a period of many years. The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via endochondral ossification. Mesenchyme accumulates around the notochord and produces hyaline cartilage models of the vertebrae. The notochord largely disappears, but remnants of the notochord contribute to formation of the intervertebral discs. In the thorax region, a portion of the vertebral cartilage model splits off to form the ribs. These then become attached anteriorly to the developing cartilage model of the sternum. Growth of the cartilage models for the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum allow for enlargement of the thoracic cage during childhood and adolescence. The cartilage models gradually undergo ossification and are converted into bone."}

{"prompt":"Question: The food particles are caught by the collar of the choanocyte and brought into the cell by what process?\nOptions:\n A. hippocampus\nB. phagocytosis\nC. cellular respiration\nD. phototropism","completion":"phagocytosis\nExplanation: Chapter 15 1 Figure 15.3 B 3 Figure 15.33 A 4 B 6 D 8 B 10 A 12 B 14 C 16 C 18 A 20 Specialized tissues allow more efficient functioning because differentiated tissue types can perform unique functions and work together in tandem to allow the animal to perform more functions. For example, specialized muscle tissue allows directed and efficient movement, and specialized nervous tissue allows for multiple sensory modalities as well as the ability to respond to various sensory information; these functions are not necessarily available to other non-animal organisms. 22 The sponges draw water carrying food particles into the spongocoel using the beating of flagella in the choanocytes. The food particles are caught by the collar of the choanocyte and brought into the cell by phagocytosis. Digestion of the food particle takes place inside the cell. The difference between this and the mechanisms of other animals is that digestion takes place within cells rather than outside of cells. It means that the organism can feed only on particles smaller than the cells themselves. 24 In a complete digestive system, food material is not mixed with waste material, so the digestion and uptake of nutrients can be more efficient. In addition, the complete digestive system allows for an orderly progression of digestion of food matter and the specialization of different zones of the digestive tract. 26 Mollusks have a large muscular foot that may be modified in various ways, such as into tentacles, but it functions in locomotion. They have a mantle, a structure of tissue that covers and encloses the dorsal portion of the animal and secretes the shell when it is present. The mantle encloses the mantle cavity, which houses the gills (when present), excretory pores, anus, and gonadopores. The coelom of mollusks is restricted to the region around the systemic heart. The main body cavity is a hemocoel. Many mollusks have a radula near the mouth that is used for scraping food. 28 During embryonic development, we also have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve tube, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. 30 A moist environment is required as frog eggs lack a shell and dehydrate quickly in dry environments."}

{"prompt":"Question: What process of gradual change is the source of diversity of life on earth?\nOptions:\n A. variation\nB. evolution\nC. creation\nD. development","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: The Diversity of Life The fact that biology, as a science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth. The source of this diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems. The evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.17). A phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split."}

{"prompt":"Question: Osmotic pressure is important in biological systems because cell walls are what?\nOptions:\n A. semipermeable membranes\nB. impassable\nC. theonym membranes\nD. variably membranes","completion":"semipermeable membranes\nExplanation: Osmotic pressure is important in biological systems because cell walls are semipermeable membranes. In particular, when a person is receiving intravenous (IV) fluids, the osmotic pressure of the fluid needs to be approximately the same as blood serum; otherwise bad things can happen. Figure 11.4 \"Osmotic Pressure and Red Blood Cells\" shows three red blood cells: Figure 11.4 \"Osmotic Pressure and Red Blood Cells\"a shows a healthy red blood cell. Figure 11.4 \"Osmotic Pressure and Red Blood Cells\"b shows a red blood cell that has been exposed to a lower concentration than normal blood serum (a socalled hypotonic solution); the cell has plumped up as solvent moves into the cell to dilute the solutes inside. Figure 11.4 \"Osmotic Pressure and Red Blood Cells\"c shows a red blood cell exposed to a higher concentration than normal blood serum (hypertonic); water leaves the red blood cell, so it collapses onto itself. Only when the solutions inside and outside the cell are the same (isotonic) will the red blood cell be able to do its job."}

{"prompt":"Question: The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. as the neural tube grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and this?\nOptions:\n A. anteriorbrain\nB. hindbrain\nC. rearbrain\nD. astrobrain","completion":"hindbrain\nExplanation: into the brain, and the posterior region becomes the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the neural groove, when it closes off, are called the neural crest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to PNS structures as well as some non-nervous tissues. The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the neural tube grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions of the adult brain. Later in development, two of these three vesicles differentiate further, resulting in five vesicles. Those five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions of the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly from the telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only region that keeps its embryonic name. The mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon become the brain stem. The cerebellum also develops from the metencephalon and is a separate region of the adult brain. The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains the tube structure, with the nervous tissue thickening and the hollow center becoming a very small central canal through the cord. The rest of the hollow center of the neural tube corresponds to open spaces within the brain called the ventricles, where cerebrospinal fluid is found."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a specific region in space within which a sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli?\nOptions:\n A. deceptive field\nB. receptive field\nC. amplify field\nD. symmetrical field","completion":"receptive field\nExplanation: CHAPTER SUMMARY 36.1 Sensory Processes A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor\u2019s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense."}
{"prompt":"Question: When an electron transitions from an excited state to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a what?\nOptions:\n A. photon\nB. neutron\nC. nucleus\nD. quark","completion":"photon\nExplanation: which is identical to the Rydberg equation for R \u221e = k . When Bohr calculated his theoretical value for the hc Rydberg constant, R \u221e, and compared it with the experimentally accepted value, he got excellent agreement. Since the Rydberg constant was one of the most precisely measured constants at that time, this level of agreement was astonishing and meant that Bohr\u2019s model was taken seriously, despite the many assumptions that Bohr needed to derive it. The lowest few energy levels are shown in Figure 6.14. One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to its initial state (Figure 6.15). In effect, an atom can \u201cstore\u201d energy by using it to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the electron returns to its ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 1), or it can be released as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to the ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 4, emitting one quantum, then to n = 1, emitting a second quantum). Since Bohr\u2019s model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions He+, Li2+, Be3+, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which Z is the nuclear charge (+1 for hydrogen, +2 for He, +3 for Li, and so on) and k has a value of 2.179 \u00d7 10\u201318 J. E n = \u2212 kZ2 n."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the accelerating pattern of increasing population size called?\nOptions:\n A. induced growth\nB. reproducing growth\nC. limited growth\nD. exponential growth","completion":"exponential growth\nExplanation: Exponential Growth Charles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted. This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth. The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000 organisms\u2014an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms. The important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate\u2014the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation\u2014is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the population size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth curve is produced (Figure 45.9). The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a population, the death rate (D) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth rate (B) (number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:."}

{"prompt":"Question: Protein chains containing 10 or fewer amino acids are usually referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. polypeptides\nB. protons\nC. carboxyl\nD. peptides","completion":"peptides\nExplanation: the conditions, amino acids can act as either acids or bases, which means that proteins act as buffers. The pH at which an amino acid exists as the zwitterion is called theisoelectric point (pI). The amino acids in a protein are linked together by peptide bonds. Protein chains containing 10 or fewer amino acids are usually referred to as peptides, with a prefix such as di- or tri- indicating the number of amino acids. Chains containing more than 50 amino acid units are referred to as proteins orpolypeptides. Proteins are classified globular or fibrous, depending on their structure and resulting solubility in water. Globular proteins are nearly spherical and are soluble in water; fibrous proteins have elongated or fibrous structures and are not soluble in water. Protein molecules can have as many as four levels of structure. The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in the chain. The secondary structure is the arrangement of adjacent atoms in the peptide chain; the most common arrangements are \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-pleated sheets. The tertiary structureis the overall three-dimensional shape of the molecule that results from the way the chain bends and folds in on itself. Proteins that consist of more than one chain have quaternary structure, which is the way the multiple chains are packed together. Four types of intramolecular and intermolecular forces contribute to secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure: (1) hydrogen bonding between an oxygen or a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom, either on the same chain or on a neighboring chain; (2) ionic bondingbetween one positively charged side chain and one negatively charged side chain; (3) disulfide linkages between cysteine units; and (4) dispersion forcesbetween nonpolar side chains. Because of their complexity, protein molecules are delicate and easy to disrupt. Adenatured protein is one whose conformation has been changed, in a process called denaturation, so that it can no longer do its physiological job. A variety of conditions, such as heat, ultraviolet radiation, the addition of organic compounds, or changes in pH can denature a protein. Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: Depending on the surrounding conditions, normal matter usually exists as one of three phases: solid, liquid, or this?\nOptions:\n A. fluid\nB. crystal\nC. gas\nD. ice","completion":"gas\nExplanation: Depending on the surrounding conditions, normal matter usually exists as one of three phases: solid, liquid, or gas. A phase change is a physical process in which a substance goes from one phase to another. Usually the change occurs when adding or removing heat at a particular temperature, known as the melting point or the boiling point of the substance. The melting point is the temperature at which the substance goes from a solid to a liquid (or from a liquid to a solid). The boiling point is the temperature at which a substance goes from a liquid to a gas (or from a gas to a liquid). The nature of the phase change depends on the direction of the heat transfer. Heat going into a substance changes it from a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a gas. Removing heat from a substance changes a gas to a liquid or a liquid to a solid. Two key points are worth emphasizing. First, at a substance\u2019s melting point or boiling point, two phases can exist simultaneously. Take water (H2O) as an example.

{"prompt":"Question: The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart rate and transmit it through the what?\nOptions:\n A. myocardium\nB. meiosis\nC. conduction\nD. neurons","completion":"myocardium\nExplanation: 19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine control, yet it is capable of initiating its own action potential followed by muscular contraction. The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart rate and transmit it through the myocardium. The contractile cells contract and propel the blood. The normal path of transmission for the conductive cells is the sinoatrial (SA) node, internodal pathways, atrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. The action potential for the conductive cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na+ followed by a rapid influx of Ca2+ and outflux of K+. Contractile cells have an action potential with an extended plateau phase that results in an extended refractory period to allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood effectively. Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the QRS complex that corresponds to ventricular depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular repolarization."}

{"prompt":"Question: Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. nodules\nB. carcinomas\nC. caricatures\nD. adenomas","completion":"carcinomas\nExplanation: Tissues and Cancer Cancer is a generic term for many diseases in which cells escape regulatory signals. Uncontrolled growth, invasion into adjacent tissues, and colonization of other organs, if not treated early enough, are its hallmarks. Health suffers when tumors \u201crob\u201d blood supply from the \u201cnormal\u201d organs. A mutation is defined as a permanent change in the DNA of a cell. Epigenetic modifications, changes that do not affect the code of the DNA but alter how the DNA is decoded, are also known to generate abnormal cells. Alterations in the genetic material may be caused by environmental agents, infectious agents, or errors in the replication of DNA that accumulate with age. Many mutations do not cause any noticeable change in the functions of a cell. However, if the modification affects key proteins that have an impact on the cell\u2019s ability to proliferate in an orderly fashion, the cell starts to divide abnormally. As changes in cells accumulate, they lose their ability to form regular tissues. A tumor, a mass of cells displaying abnormal architecture, forms in the tissue. Many tumors are benign, meaning they do not metastasize nor cause disease. A tumor becomes malignant, or cancerous, when it breaches the confines of its tissue, promotes angiogenesis, attracts the growth of capillaries, and metastasizes to other organs (Figure 4.22). The specific names of cancers reflect the tissue of origin. Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as carcinomas. Cancer in myeloid tissue or blood cells form myelomas. Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells, whereas sarcomas derive from connective tissue. Cells in tumors differ both in structure and function. Some cells, called cancer stem cells, appear to be a subtype of cell responsible for uncontrolled growth. Recent research shows that contrary to what was previously assumed, tumors are not disorganized masses of cells, but have their own structures."}
{"prompt":"Question: When a balloon is rubbed against hair, they attract each other because of a difference in what?\nOptions:\n A. Force\nB. charges\nC. Friction\nD. actions","completion":"charges\nExplanation: Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in Figure below . Friction between the rubber of the balloon and the baby\u2019s hair results in electrons from the hair \"rubbing off\" onto the balloon. That\u2019s because rubber attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. As a result, the individual hairs repel each other and the balloon and the hair attract each other. Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons."}

{"prompt":"Question: The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between what and the internal organs?\nOptions:\n A. hormones\nB. somatic system\nC. central nervous system\nD. peripheral nervous system","completion":"central nervous system\nExplanation: The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed. Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ (Figure 16.24). There are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the immediate responses an animal makes when it encounters a dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response a person feels when encountering a snake (\u201csnake\u201d and \u201csympathetic\u201d both begin with \u201cs\u201d). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism\u2019s body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface?\nOptions:\n A. spreading friction\nB. sliding friction\nC. static friction\nD. rolling friction","completion":"sliding friction\nExplanation: Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. That\u2019s why it\u2019s easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil. The pencil \u201clead\u201d slides easily over the paper, but there\u2019s just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a mark."}

{"prompt":"Question: Lactose intolerance is a condition characterized by indigestion caused by this?\nOptions:\n A. fried products\nB. raw products\nC. dairy products\nD. pasteurized products","completion":"dairy products\nExplanation: Small Intestine: Lactose Intolerance Lactose intolerance is a condition characterized by indigestion caused by dairy products. It occurs when the absorptive cells of the small intestine do not produce enough lactase, the enzyme that digests the milk sugar lactose. In most mammals, lactose intolerance increases with age. In contrast, some human populations, most notably Caucasians, are able to maintain the ability to produce lactase as adults. In people with lactose intolerance, the lactose in chyme is not digested. Bacteria in the large intestine ferment the undigested lactose, a process that produces gas. In addition to gas, symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea. Symptom severity ranges from mild discomfort to severe pain; however, symptoms resolve once the lactose is eliminated in feces. The hydrogen breath test is used to help diagnose lactose intolerance. Lactose-tolerant people have very little hydrogen in their breath. Those with lactose intolerance exhale hydrogen, which is one of the gases produced by the bacterial fermentation of lactose in the colon. After the hydrogen is absorbed from the intestine, it is transported through blood vessels into the lungs. There are a number of lactose-free dairy products available in grocery stores. In addition, dietary supplements are available. Taken with food, they provide lactase to help digest lactose."}
{"prompt":"Question: Friction does negative work and removes some of the energy the person expends and converts it to which kind of energy?\nOptions:\n A. erosion\nB. thermal\nC. hydro\nD. evaporation","completion":"thermal\nExplanation: Discussion for (a) This value is the net work done on the package.

It is a mixture that contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen gases, with very small amounts of several other gases. The circle graph in the Figure below shows the composition of air. Because air is a solution, it is homogeneous. In other words, no matter where you go, the air always contains the same proportion of gases that are shown in the graph."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is another name for molecular compounds?\nOptions:\n A. covalent compounds\nB. phenotype compounds\nC. oxidized compounds\nD. synthetic compounds","completion":"covalent compounds\nExplanation: The physical state and properties of a particular compound depend in large part on the type of chemical bonding it displays. Molecular compounds , sometimes called covalent compounds, display a wide range of physical properties due to the different types of intermolecular attractions such as different kinds of polar interactions. The melting and boiling points of molecular compounds are generally quite low compared to those of ionic compounds . This is because the energy required to disrupt the intermolecular forces between molecules is far less than the energy required to break the ionic bonds in a crystalline ionic compound. Since molecular compounds are composed of neutral molecules, their electrical conductivity is generally quite poor, whether in the solid or liquid state. Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state because of their rigid structure, but conduct well when either molten or dissolved into a solution. The water solubility of molecular compounds is variable and depends primarily on the type of intermolecular forces involved. Substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole forces are generally water soluble, whereas those that exhibit only London dispersion forces are generally insoluble. Most, but not all, ionic compounds are quite soluble in water. Table below summarizes some of the differences between ionic and molecular compounds."}

The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isn't valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is produced when a base is dissolved in water?\nOptions:\n A. hydroxide ions\nB. alkaline ions\nC. synthesis ions\nD. ingredient ions","completion":"hydroxide ions\nExplanation: Acids are ionic compounds that produce positively charged hydrogen ions (H + ) when dissolved in water. Acids taste sour and react with metals. Bases are ionic compounds that produce negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH - ) when dissolved in water. Bases taste bitter and do not react with metals. Examples of acids are vinegar and battery acid. The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad. The acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through skin. Examples of bases include those in antacid tablets and drain cleaner. Bases in antacid tablets are weak enough to take for an upset stomach. Bases in drain cleaner are strong enough to cause serious burns."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is continually released during childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism and prompts uterine contractions to fetal head toward the cervix?\nOptions:\n A. hemoglobin\nB. oxytocin\nC. insulin\nD. vasopressin","completion":"oxytocin\nExplanation: muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth. Although the mother\u2019s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to as \u201clet-down\u201d) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother\u2019s milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant\u2019s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent\u2013newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the ice crystals that form on the ground called?\nOptions:\n A. frost\nB. snow\nC. granules\nD. sleet","completion":"frost\nExplanation: Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature.

{"prompt":"Question: How many amino acids are arranged like \"beads on a string\" to form proteins?\nOptions:\n A. 15\nB. 20\nC. 35\nD. 25","completion":"20\nExplanation: Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids . Recall that there are 20 different amino acids arranged like \"beads on a string\" to form proteins. These amino acid chains then fold up into a three-dimensional molecule, giving the protein a specific function. Proteins have several important roles in the body. For example, proteins make up antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes that help control cell and body processes. You need to make sure you have enough protein in your diet to obtain the necessary amino acids to make your proteins."}
{"prompt":"Question: How are valuable metabolites recovered?\nOptions:\n A. replication reaction\nB. reabsorption\nC. osmosis\nD. metabolism","completion":"reabsorption\nExplanation: Flame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms As multi-cellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs evolved to perform the excretory function. Planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated in Figure 41.10a. The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They also maintain the organism\u2019s osmotic balance."}

The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum. It is outlined in the following Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do structures of the human eye collect and focus?\nOptions:\n A. sugars\nB. light\nC. air\nD. electricity","completion":"light\nExplanation: The structures of the human eye collect and focus light.

{"prompt":"Question: Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is pumped into the what?\nOptions:\n A. bronchial circulation\nB. pulmonary circuit\nC. respiratory system\nD. kidneys","completion":"pulmonary circuit\nExplanation: Figure 19.4 Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is pumped into the pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively high in carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, blood enters the left ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit. Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision?\nOptions:\n A. cornea\nB. fovea\nC. lens\nD. pupil","completion":"fovea\nExplanation: The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of cones. When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object\u2019s image falls on the fovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low light. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea."}

The highest cliff of a cirque is called the headwall."}
{"prompt":"Question: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?\nOptions:\n A. atom\nB. nucleus\nC. molecules\nD. protons","completion":"nucleus\nExplanation: Binary Fission Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate."}

{"prompt":"Question: What major pigment in the photosynthetic system is based on a complex molecule and gives plants their green color?\nOptions:\n A. chloroplasm\nB. chlorophyll\nC. melanin\nD. cadmium","completion":"chlorophyll\nExplanation: membrane gradients was known, Mitchell proposed that energy captured through the absorption of light (by phototrophs) or the breakdown of molecules into more stable molecules (by various types of chemotrophs) relied on the same basic (homologous) mechanism, namely the generation of H+ gradients across membranes (the plasma membrane in prokaryotes or the internal membranes of mitochondria or chloroplasts (intracellular organelles, derived from bacteria \u2013 see below) in eukaryotes. What makes us think that these processes might have a similar evolutionary root, that they are homologous? Basically, it is the observation that in both light- and chemical-based processes captured energy is transferred through the movement of electrons through a membrane-embedded \u201celectron transport chain\u201d. An electron transport chain involves a series of membrane and associated proteins and a series of reduction-oxidation or redox reactions (see below) during which electrons move from a high energy donor to a lower energy acceptor. Some of the energy difference between the two is used to move H+ ions across a membrane, generating a H+ concentration gradient. Subsequently the thermodynamically favorable movement of H+ down this concentration gradient (across the membrane) is used to drive ATP synthesis, a thermodynamically unfavorable process. ATP synthesis itself involves the rotating ATP synthase. The reaction can be written: H+outside + ADP + Pi ATP + H2O + H+inside, where \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d refer to compartments defined by the membrane containing the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase. Again, this reaction can run backwards. When this occurs, the ATP synthase acts as an ATPase (ATP hydrolase) that can pump H+ (or other molecules) against its concentration gradient. Such pumping ATPases establishes most biologically important molecular gradients across membranes. In such a reaction: ATP + H2O + molecule in low concentration region ADP + Pi + molecule in low concentration region. The most important difference between phototrophs and chemotrophs is how high energy electrons enter the electron transport chain. Oxygenic photosynthesis \u2028 Compared to the salt loving archaea Halobium with its purple bacteriorhodopin-rich membranes, photosynthetic cyanobacteria (which are true bacteria), green algae, and higher plants (both eukaryotes) use more complex molecular systems through which to capture and utilize light. In all of these organisms, their photosynthetic systems appear to be homologous, that is derived from a common ancestor, a topic we will return to later in this chapter. For simplicity\u2019s sake we will describe the photosynthetic system of cyanobacterium; the system in eukaryotic algae and plants, while more complex, follows the same basic logic. At this point, we consider only one aspect of this photosynthetic system, known as the oxygenic or non-cyclic system (look to more advanced classes for more details. ) The major pigment in this system, chlorophyll, is based on a complex molecule, a porphyrin (see above) and it is primarily these pigments that give plants their green color. As in the case of retinal, they absorb visible light due to the presence of a conjugated bonding structure (drawn as a series of alternating single and double) carbon-carbon bonds. Chlorophyll is synthesized by a conserved biosynthetic pathway that is also used to synthesize heme, which is found in the hemoglobin of animals and in the cytochromes, within the electron transport chain present in both plants and animals (which."}

{"prompt":"Question: The complete combustion of alkanes to carbon dioxide is an extremely __________ reaction.\nOptions:\n A. hydrolic\nB. geothermal\nC. exothermic\nD. reactive","completion":"exothermic\nExplanation: Each step in the process is either a gain of oxygen or a loss of hydrogen. Each step also releases energy, which explains why the complete combustion of alkanes to carbon dioxide is an extremely exothermic reaction."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is produced during the light reactions in photosynthesis?\nOptions:\n A. carbon\nB. waste\nC. nitrogen\nD. oxygen","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Photosynthesis begins with the light reactions. It is during these reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy is then temporarily transferred to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second stage of photosynthesis. ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron transport chains . During the light reactions, water is used and oxygen is produced. These reactions can only occur during daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin."}
{"prompt":"Question: Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel and are thought to be very similar to what part of the earth?\nOptions:\n A. crust\nB. core\nC. shelf\nD. mantel","completion":"core\nExplanation: Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earth\u2019s interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent early solar system materials. Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel.

{"prompt":"Question: What effect does tamiflu have on viruses and cells?\nOptions:\n A. destroys all viruses\nB. reprograms viruses\nC. enhances cells\nD. inhibits spread of virus","completion":"inhibits spread of virus\nExplanation: an enzyme (viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected cells. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections, although its mechanism of action against certain viruses remains unclear."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of radioactive decay is generally only dangerous when emitted inside the body?\nOptions:\n A. alpha decay\nB. ionic decay\nC. variant decay\nD. nucleus decay","completion":"alpha decay\nExplanation: All types of radioactive decay pose risks to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous. That\u2019s because alpha particles are relatively heavy, so they can travel only a few centimeters through the air. They also are not very penetrating. For example, they can\u2019t pass through a sheet of paper or thin layer of clothing. They may burn the skin, but they can\u2019t penetrate to the tissues underneath the skin. However, if alpha particles are emitted inside the body, they can do more damage. One way this can happen is by inhaling cigarette smoke. People who smoke actually inhale the radioactive element polonium-210. It undergoes alpha decay in the lungs. Over time, exposure to alpha particles may cause lung cancer."}

But the genotype ratios of their actual offspring may differ. That's because which gametes happen to unite is a matter of chance, like a coin toss. The Punnett square just shows the possible genotypes and their most likely ratios."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do we call coiled structures made of dna and proteins?\nOptions:\n A. chromosomes\nB. nodes\nC. Organisms\nD.

{"prompt":"Question: At high pressures, how are the molecules of a gas crowded?\nOptions:\n A. few together\nB. closer together\nC. further apart\nD. small together","completion":"closer together\nExplanation: Particles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas (Figure 9.36). The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportional as predicted by Boyle\u2019s law."}

You can see clearly through transparent objects, such as the top panes of the window below , because just about all of the light that strikes them passes through to the other side."}
{"prompt":"Question: By allowing blood levels of a hormone to be regulated within a narrow range, feedback loops contribute to maintaining what state?\nOptions:\n A. hypothesis\nB. hibernation\nC. consciousness\nD. homeostasis","completion":"homeostasis\nExplanation: Role of Feedback Loops The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine muscles to contract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child. The more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized by the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood levels of the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As glucocorticoid concentrations in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of solvents is glucose insoluble in?\nOptions:\n A. nonpolar\nB. alkaline\nC. polar\nD. acidic","completion":"nonpolar\nExplanation: The same principles govern the solubilities of molecular solids in liquids. For example, elemental sulfur is a solid consisting of cyclic S8 molecules that have no dipole moment. Because the S8 rings in solid sulfur are held to other rings by London dispersion forces, elemental sulfur is insoluble in water. It is, however, soluble in nonpolar solvents that have comparable London dispersion forces, such as CS2 (23 g\/100 mL). In contrast, glucose contains five \u2013OH groups that can form hydrogen bonds. Consequently, glucose is very soluble in water (91 g\/120 mL of water) but essentially insoluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene. The structure of one isomer of glucose is shown here."}
{"prompt":"Question: What oily substance prevents the hair and skin of living things from drying out?\nOptions:\n A. pus\nB. progesterone\nC. sebum\nD. pancreatic enzymes","completion":"sebum\nExplanation: Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate?\nOptions:\n A. epidermis\nB. cambium\nC. ganglion\nD. meristem","completion":"meristem\nExplanation: Most plants continue to grow as long as they live. They grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division (mitosis). The key to plant growth is meristem, a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. Meristem allows plant stems and roots to grow longer (primary growth) and wider (secondary growth)."}

Catalysts in living things are called enzymes."}
{"prompt":"Question: Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward what?\nOptions:\n A. the north pole\nB. sunlight\nC. trees\nD. the south pole","completion":"sunlight\nExplanation: Plant Responses to Gravity Whether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots grow downward into the ground. A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time. Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight. Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism. Amyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity. Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap. When a plant is tilted, the statoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall. A few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical direction. The mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood. When amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the gravity-sensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing the release of calcium ions from inside the ER. This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone IAA to."}

{"prompt":"Question: Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and do what through a characteristic form of emission?\nOptions:\n A. replicate\nB. bond\nC. expand\nD. decay","completion":"decay\nExplanation: Whether or not a given isotope is radioactive is a characteristic of that particular isotope. Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission. As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases. An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half-life, which is the amount of time it takes for one-half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope. Consider the following example. Suppose we have 100.0 g of tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen). It has a half-life of 12.3 y. After 12.3 y, half of the sample will have decayed from hydrogen-3 to helium-3 by emitting a beta particle, so that only 50.0 g of the original tritium remains. After another 12.3 y\u2014 making a total of 24.6 y\u2014another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 25.0 g of tritium. After another 12.3 y\u2014now a total of 36.9 y\u2014another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 12.5 g. This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 15.1 \"Radioactive Decay\". Figure 15.1 Radioactive Decay."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do scientists attach to aquatic animals to collect information?\nOptions:\n A. ultraviolet tags\nB. radio tags\nC. satellite tags\nD. fluorescent tags","completion":"satellite tags\nExplanation: Beginning in 2000, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Stanford University, and the University of California, Santa Cruz combined to form TOPP. As part of TOPP, researchers attach satellite tags to elephant seals, white sharks, giant leatherback turtles, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and other marine animals. The tags collect information, such as how deep each animal dives, the levels of ambient light (to help determine an animal\u2019s location), and interior and exterior body temperature. Some tags also collect information about the temperature, salinity, and depth of the water surrounding an animal to help scientists identify ocean currents. The tags send the data to a satellite, which in turn sends the data the scientists. They use this information to create maps of migration patterns and discover new information about different marine ecosystems. The information collected by TOPP offers rare insights into the lives of marine animals. Without TOPP, that information would otherwise remain unknown. With TOPP, scientists are developing a working knowledge of the particular migration routes animals take, as well as the locations of popular breeding grounds and the environmental dangers faced by different species. TOPP has shed light on how we can better protect the leatherback turtle and other endangered species."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because conifers carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte, they are considered what type of plant?\nOptions:\n A. siliceous\nB. bioecious\nC. dioecious\nD. monoecious","completion":"monoecious\nExplanation: Life Cycle of a Conifer Pine trees are conifers (cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte. Therefore, they are monoecious plants. Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. In the male cones, or staminate cones, the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis. In the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some gametophytes will land on a female cone. Pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth. The pollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells will finally unite its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of a haploid egg cell. Female cones, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. One megaspore mother cell, or megasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule. Three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg). Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. Fertilization and seed development is a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination. The seed that is formed contains three generations of tissues: the seed coat that originates from the sporophyte tissue, the gametophyte that will provide nutrients, and the embryo itself."}

{"prompt":"Question: While normal light microscopes can magnify objects up to about 1,500 times, what advanced instruments can magnify objects up to 1,000,000 times?\nOptions:\n A. electron microscopes\nB. magnetic microscopes\nC. micro microscopes\nD. electric microscopes","completion":"electron microscopes\nExplanation: Normal light microscopes can magnify objects up to about 1,500 times. Electron microscopes can magnify objects up to 1,000,000 times. Why can electron microscopes magnify images so much? A microscope\u2019s resolution depends on the wavelength of light used. The smaller the wavelength, the more a microscope can magnify. Light is a wave, and, as such, it has a wavelength associated with it. The wavelength of visible light, which is detected by the eyes, varies from about 700 nm to about 400 nm. One of the startling conclusions about modern science is that electrons also act as waves. However, the wavelength of electrons is much, much shorter\u2014about 0.5 to 1 nm. This allows electron microscopes to magnify 600\u2013700 times more than light microscopes. This allows us to see even smaller features in a world that is invisible to the naked eye. Atoms act the way they do because of their structure. We already know that atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, and electrons orbit around the nucleus. But we need to know the structural details to understand why atoms react the way they do. Virtually everything we know about atoms ultimately comes from light. Before we can understand the composition of atoms (especially electrons), we need to understand the properties of light."}
{"prompt":"Question: How does litmus paper indicate the ph value of a solution?\nOptions:\n A. by texture\nB. by shape\nC. by smell\nD. by color","completion":"by color\nExplanation: There are two common ways to measure pH. When only an approximate pH value is needed, an inexpensive test involves the use of acid-base indicators , which change color based on the relative acidity of the solution. One type of common indicator is litmus paper. For example, if a piece of litmus paper is dipped into an acidic solution (pH below ~4.5), it will turn red, and dipping it into a basic solution (pH above ~8.5) will turn it blue. Solutions of intermediate pH will result in various shades of purple. Because different indicators change color at different pH values, the use of multiple indicators can generally narrow down the possible pH of a solution to a range of about 0.5-1 pH units. Figure below shows the colors exhibited by various indicators at different pH values."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where does most of the sound we hear travel through?\nOptions:\n A. air\nB. water\nC. light\nD. the ground","completion":"air\nExplanation: Most of the sounds we hear reach our ears through the air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids. If you swim underwater\u2014or even submerge your ears in bathwater\u2014any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears through the water. Some solids, including glass and metals, are very good at transmitting sounds. Foam rubber and heavy fabrics, on the other hand, tend to muffle sounds. They absorb rather than pass on the sound energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: In what type of diabetes can the pancreas still make insulin, but the cells of the body cannot use it efficiently?\nOptions:\n A. type 2 diabetes\nB. type 3 diabetes\nC. type 1 diabetes\nD. type A diabetes","completion":"type 2 diabetes\nExplanation: Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells are no longer sensitive to insulin. The pancreas may still make insulin, but the cells of the body cannot use it efficiently. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but it is becoming more common in teens and children. This is because more young people are overweight, due to a high sugar and fat diet, now than ever before."}

{"prompt":"Question: What instrument made it possible to study pressure quantitatively?\nOptions:\n A. barometer\nB. anemometer\nC. seismograph\nD. thermometer","completion":"barometer\nExplanation: The thermometer was developed a short time after the barometer made it possible to study pressure in a quantitative manner. Although crude thermometers had been available for quite some time, Daniel Fahrenheit constructed a more accurate thermometer in 1724 using mercury in glass. Because the height of the mercury in the thermometer was a relative measure, certain fixed points needed to be defined. Originally, Fahrenheit defined a 1:1:1 mixture of ice, salt, and ammonium chloride as 0\u00b0F, and the freezing\/melting point of ice as 32\u00b0F. On this scale, the normal temperature of the human body is 96\u00b0F, and the boiling point of water is 212\u00b0C. The modern Fahrenheit scale is defined in terms of the normal freezing and boiling points of water."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule?\nOptions:\n A. molecular mass\nB. compound mass\nC. mass effect\nD. atomic energy","completion":"molecular mass\nExplanation: Note: Atomic mass is given to three decimal places, if known. Now that we understand that atoms have mass, it is easy to extend the concept to the mass of molecules. The molecular mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule. This may seem like a trivial extension of the concept, but it is important to count the number of each type of atom in the molecular formula. Also, although each atom in a molecule is a particular isotope, we use the weighted average, or atomic mass, for each atom in the molecule. For example, if we were to determine the molecular mass of dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3, we would need to add the atomic mass of nitrogen two times with the atomic mass of oxygen three times:."}

Specific heat is a measure of how much energy is needed to change the temperature of a substance; the larger the specific heat, the more energy is needed to change the temperature. The units for specific heat are depending on what the unit of \u0394Tis. You may note a departure from the insistence that temperature be expressed in Kelvin. That is because a change in temperature has the same value whether the temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius or kelvins."}
{"prompt":"Question: What process provides over 99 percent of the energy for life on earth?\nOptions:\n A. farming\nB. glycolysis\nC. photosynthesis\nD. fracking","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Photosynthesis provides over 99 percent of the energy for life on earth. A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis , and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure below . Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or \u201cblack smokers. \u201d There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth\u2019s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food."}

{"prompt":"Question: How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of what, in the outer energy level of their atoms?\nOptions:\n A. protons\nB. positrons\nC. neutrons\nD. electrons","completion":"electrons\nExplanation: How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level. Boron, pictured in the Figure below , is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions. Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction."}

{"prompt":"Question: Class bivalvia (\u201ctwo shells\u201d) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and these?\nOptions:\n A. geoducks\nB. grendels\nC. crabs\nD. octopuss","completion":"geoducks\nExplanation: Class Bivalvia (\u201ctwo shells\u201d) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and geoducks. Members of this class are found in marine as well as freshwater habitats. As the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in a pair of shells (valves are commonly called \u201cshells\u201d) that are hinged at the dorsal end by shell ligaments as well as shell teeth (Figure 28.22). The overall morphology is laterally flattened, and the head region is poorly developed. Eyespots and statocysts may be absent in some species. Since these animals are suspension feeders, a radula is absent in this class of mollusks. Respiration is facilitated by a pair of ctenidia, whereas excretion and osmoregulation are brought about by a pair of nephridia. Bivalves often possess a large mantle cavity. In some species, the posterior edges of the mantle may fuse to form two siphons that serve to take in and exude water."}

The Golgi apparatus looks like stacked flattened discs, almost like stacks of oddly shaped pancakes. Like the ER, these discs are membranous. The Golgi apparatus has two distinct sides, each with a different role. One side of the apparatus receives products in vesicles. These products are sorted through the apparatus, and then they are released from the opposite side after being repackaged into new vesicles. If the product is to be exported from the cell, the vesicle migrates to the cell surface and fuses to the cell membrane, and the cargo is secreted (Figure 3.15)."}

{"prompt":"Question: The protist life cycle benefits by including what forms of reproduction?\nOptions:\n A. asexual and biological\nB. atypical and sexual\nC. asexual and sexual\nD. ideal and sexual","completion":"asexual and sexual\nExplanation: Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation. This helps ensure that some organisms will survive if conditions change."}
{"prompt":"Question: What two cycles make up the female reproductive cycle?\nOptions:\n A. ovarian and cesarean\nB. cervical and menstrual\nC. ovarian and menstrual\nD. digestive and menstrual","completion":"ovarian and menstrual\nExplanation: Female Hormones The control of reproduction in females is more complex. The female reproductive cycle is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining (Figure 18.17). These cycles are coordinated over a 22\u201332 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days. As with the male, the GnRH from the hypothalamus causes the release of the hormones FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. In addition, estrogen and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. As with testosterone in males, estrogen is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period for bone growth. The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle The ovarian and menstrual cycles are regulated by hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries (Figure 18.17). The ebb and flow of the hormones causes the ovarian and menstrual cycles to advance. The ovarian and menstrual cycles occur concurrently. The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase. Slowly rising levels of FSH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogen. The first few days of this cycle coincide with menstruation or the sloughing off of the functional layer of the endometrium in the uterus. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term means the percentage by mass of each element in a compound?\nOptions:\n A. mass effect\nB. elemental percent\nC. biomass\nD. percent composition","completion":"percent composition\nExplanation: Percent Composition The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas are the most succinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compound\u2019s formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its constituent elements is often the first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of these measurements permit the calculation of the compound\u2019s percent composition, defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen.

{"prompt":"Question: The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is known as genetic what?\nOptions:\n A. group\nB. density\nC. variance\nD. variable","completion":"variance\nExplanation: Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that acquired traits could, in fact, be inherited; while this hypothesis has largely been unsupported, scientists have recently begun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong. Visit this site (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/epigenetic) to learn more. Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among individuals in a population. The greater the hereditability of a population\u2019s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation. The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population\u2019s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variances."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of interference is observed when the paths differ by a whole wavelength, and the waves arrive in phase?\nOptions:\n A. necessary interference\nB. constructive interference\nC. non-interference\nD. spontaneous interference","completion":"constructive interference\nExplanation: To understand the double slit interference pattern, we consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen, as illustrated in Figure 27.13. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they may end up out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively as shown in Figure 27.13(a). If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively as shown in."}

The evolution of amniotic membranes meant that the embryos of amniotes were provided with their own aquatic environment, which led to less dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to branch out into drier environments. This was a significant development that distinguished them from amphibians, which were restricted to moist environments due their shell-less eggs. Although the shells of various amniotic species vary significantly, they all allow retention of water. The shells of bird eggs are composed of calcium carbonate and are hard, but fragile. The shells of reptile eggs are leathery and require a moist environment. Most mammals do not lay eggs (except for monotremes). Instead, the embryo grows within the mother\u2019s body; however, even with this internal gestation, amniotic membranes are still present."}

The burning of fuels that provides the energy to maintain our civilization and the metabolism of foods that furnish the energy that keeps us alive both involve redox reactions. All combustion reactions are also redox reactions. A typical combustion reaction is the burning of methane, the principal component of natural gas (Figure 5.5 \"The Burning of Natural Gas\"). CH4 + 2O2 \u2192 CO2 + 2H2O In respiration, the biochemical process by which the oxygen we inhale in air oxidizes foodstuffs to carbon dioxide and water, redox reactions provide energy to living cells. A typical respiratory reaction is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6), the simple sugar we encountered in the chapter-opening essay that makes up the diet of yeast: C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u2192 6CO2 + 6H2O Organic chemists use a variety of redox reactions.

{"prompt":"Question: The primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that output to where?\nOptions:\n A. effect cortex\nB. Back cortex\nC. cerebral cortex\nD. suffering cortex","completion":"cerebral cortex\nExplanation: Thalamus The thalamus is a collection of nuclei that relay information between the cerebral cortex and the periphery, spinal cord, or brain stem. All sensory information, except for the sense of smell, passes through the thalamus before processing by the cortex. Axons from the peripheral sensory organs, or intermediate nuclei, synapse in the thalamus, and thalamic neurons project directly to the cerebrum. It is a requisite synapse in any sensory pathway, except for olfaction. The thalamus does not just pass the information on, it also processes that information. For example, the portion of the thalamus that receives visual information will influence what visual stimuli are important, or what receives attention. The cerebrum also sends information down to the thalamus, which usually communicates motor commands. This involves interactions with the cerebellum and other nuclei in the brain stem. The cerebrum interacts with the basal nuclei, which involves connections with the thalamus. The primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that output to the cerebral cortex. The cortex also sends information to the thalamus that will then influence the effects of the basal nuclei."}

The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration. The relationship between mass and acceleration, on the other hand, is an inverse relationship. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force."}
{"prompt":"Question: Bromine is much less abundant than fluorine or chlorine, but it is easily recovered from seawater, which contains about 65 mg of br\u2212 per what?\nOptions:\n A. liter\nB. pound\nC. foot\nD. gallon","completion":"liter\nExplanation: electrolysis2NaOH ( aq )\u00a0+\u00a0Cl2 ( g )\u00a0+\u00a0H 2 ( g ) Bromine is much less abundant than fluorine or chlorine, but it is easily recovered from seawater, which contains about 65 mg of Br\u2212 per liter. Salt lakes and underground brines are even richer sources; for example, the Dead Sea contains 4 g of Br\u2212 per liter. Iodine is the least abundant of the nonradioactive halogens, and it is a relatively rare element. Because of its low electronegativity, iodine tends to occur in nature in an oxidized form. Hence most commercially important deposits of iodine, such as those in the Chilean desert, are iodate salts such as Ca(IO3)2. The production of iodine from such deposits therefore requires reduction rather than oxidation. The process is typically carried out in two steps: reduction of iodate to iodide with sodium hydrogen sulfite, followed by reaction of iodide with additional iodate: Equation 22.41."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the two possible reduction products for brf3?\nOptions:\n A. brg and brf\nB. brf and br2\nC. brf2 and brf4\nD. brf and brf4","completion":"brf and br2\nExplanation: redox reaction will occur. The only question is whether lead will be oxidized to Pb(II) or Pb(IV). Because BrF3 is a powerful oxidant and fluorine is able to stabilize high oxidation states of other elements, it is likely that PbF4 will be the product. The two possible reduction products for BrF3 are BrF and Br2. The actual product will likely depend on the ratio of the reactants used. With excess BrF3, we expect the more oxidized product (BrF). With lower ratios of oxidant to lead, we would probably obtain Br2 as the product. Exercise Predict the products of each reaction and write a balanced chemical equation for each reaction."}

This volcano is next to the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hotspot. The oldest is the farthest away ( Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: Net production efficiency allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular what incorporate the energy they receive into biomass?\nOptions:\n A. hypothesized level\nB. neural level\nC. sea level\nD. trophic level","completion":"trophic level\nExplanation: In Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. The low efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food web. The fact is, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level. In the Lake Ontario example shown in Figure 46.6, only three energy transfers occurred between the primary producer, (green algae), and the apex consumer (Chinook salmon). Ecologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems. Some transfers are easier or more difficult to measure depending on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the ecosystem. In other words, some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of energy transfers has to be estimated. Another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency. Net production efficiency (NPE) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it is calculated using the following formula:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What causes a lot of geological activity on the earth?\nOptions:\n A. landslides\nB. plate tectonics\nC. weather\nD. natural selection","completion":"plate tectonics\nExplanation: Plate tectonic processes explain why we see many types of geological activity where we do. Stresses build up in some locations. These stresses may cause folding or faulting. Earthquakes strike along all three types of plate boundaries. The most damaging earthquakes are shallow focus. People in earthquake-prone regions must be aware of the potential damage from earthquakes. Seismologists have scales for measuring earthquake intensity and magnitude. Cities in earthquake zones must build safe structures. They also have guidelines for being safe in earthquakes. Earthquakes are often associated with volcanoes. Volcanoes erupt at all types of plate boundaries except transform. Volcanic eruptions can be quiet or explosive. Volcanoes have a variety of shapes. The shapes range from large shields, to classic peaks, to small cones. Supervolcano eruptions are rare but extremely deadly. Volcanic activity creates unique landforms. Hot springs and geysers result when water meets hot rock below ground. Some geological activity, both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, is located away from plate boundaries."}

{"prompt":"Question: In headwater streams, what plant process is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks?\nOptions:\n A. photosynthesis\nB. mitosis\nC. symbiosis\nD. reproduction","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. The channel (the width of the river or stream) is narrower here than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Headwater streams are of necessity at a higher elevation than the mouth of the river and often originate in regions with steep grades leading to higher flow rates than lower elevation stretches of the river. Faster-moving water and the short distance from its origin results in minimal silt levels in headwater streams; therefore, the water is clear. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton. Photosynthesis may be further reduced by tree cover reaching over the narrow stream. This shading also keeps temperatures lower. An additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into a river or stream from the trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. The leaves also support a food chain of invertebrates that eat them and are in turn eaten by predatory invertebrates and fish. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place. In temperate regions, freshwater trout species (phylum Chordata) may be an important predator in these fast-moving and colder river and streams."}

All animals are eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, and almost all animals have a complex tissue structure with differentiated and specialized tissues. Most animals are motile, at least during certain life stages. All animals require a source of food and are therefore heterotrophic, ingesting other living or dead organisms; this feature distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which synthesize their own nutrients through photosynthesis. As heterotrophs, animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, or parasites (Figure 27.2ab). Most animals reproduce sexually, and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan. The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal, determined by developmental cues."}
{"prompt":"Question: Concentration is the removal of solvent, which increases the concentration of what?\nOptions:\n A. vapor\nB. solute\nC. sodium\nD. Water","completion":"solute\nExplanation: Often, a worker will need to change the concentration of a solution by changing the amount of solvent. Dilution is the addition of solvent, which decreases the concentration of the solute in the solution. Concentration is the removal of solvent, which increases the concentration of the solute in the solution. (Do not confuse the two uses of the word concentration here!) In both dilution and concentration, the amount of solute stays the same. This gives us a way to calculate what the new solution volume must be for the desired concentration of solute. From the definition of molarity,."}
{"prompt":"Question: Electromagnetic waves transfer energy across space as well as through what?\nOptions:\n A. matter\nB. osmosis\nC. filtering\nD. plasma","completion":"matter\nExplanation: Electromagnetic waves transfer energy across space as well as through matter.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the color of the powder of a mineral?\nOptions:\n A. gray\nB. organic\nC. streak\nD. blue","completion":"streak\nExplanation: Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the plate. The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample, as Figure below shows."}
{"prompt":"Question: Referring to low what, hypovolemia may be caused by bleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension?\nOptions:\n A. heart volume\nB. brain volume\nC. blood volume\nD. Secretion Volume","completion":"blood volume\nExplanation: Blood Volume The relationship between blood volume, blood pressure, and blood flow is intuitively obvious. Water may merely trickle along a creek bed in a dry season, but rush quickly and under great pressure after a heavy rain. Similarly, as blood volume decreases, pressure and flow decrease. As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase. Under normal circumstances, blood volume varies little. Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by bleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension. It is important to recognize that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an individual may be asymptomatic until 10\u201320 percent of the blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid replacement. Hypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with heart failure, liver cirrhosis, some forms of kidney disease, hyperaldosteronism, and some glucocorticoid steroid treatments. Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of doctor specializes in the laboratory detection of disease?\nOptions:\n A. internist\nB. pathologist\nC. diagnostician\nD. infectious disease physician","completion":"pathologist\nExplanation: Pathologist A pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease in animals, including humans. These professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an extensive post-graduate residency at a medical center.

{"prompt":"Question: What sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the embryo as it folds?\nOptions:\n A. amniotic sac\nB. uterus\nC. umbilical sac\nD. epithelial sac","completion":"amniotic sac\nExplanation: The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a cylindrical shape through the process of embryonic folding (Figure 28.14). The embryo folds laterally and again at either end, forming a C-shape with distinct head and tail ends. The embryo envelops a portion of the yolk sac, which protrudes with the umbilical cord from what will become the abdomen. The folding essentially creates a tube, called the primitive gut, that is lined by the endoderm. The amniotic sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the embryo as it folds."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of fibers are used to transport telephone and television signals?\nOptions:\n A. touch fibers\nB. process fibers\nC. optical fibers\nD. hair fibers","completion":"optical fibers\nExplanation: Total internal reflection allows the light to travel down the optical fiber and not pass through the sides of the tube. The light continuously reflects from the inside of the tube and eventually comes out the end. Optical fibers make interesting lamps but they are also used to transport telephone and television signals."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the organ in which gas exchanges take place between blood and air?\nOptions:\n A. heart\nB. skin\nC. lungs\nD. kidney","completion":"lungs\nExplanation: Respiration begins with ventilation.

{"prompt":"Question: The action of sunlight on the skin triggers the body to produce what vitamin?\nOptions:\n A. Vitamin A\nB. vitamin d\nC. metabolic d\nD. tissue d","completion":"vitamin d\nExplanation: Milk and other dairy foods are not the only sources of calcium. This important nutrient is also found in green leafy vegetables, broccoli, and intact salmon and canned sardines with their soft bones. Nuts, beans, seeds, and shellfish provide calcium in smaller quantities. Except for fatty fish like salmon and tuna, or fortified milk or cereal, vitamin D is not found naturally in many foods. The action of sunlight on the skin triggers the body to produce its own vitamin D (Figure 6.22), but many people, especially those of darker complexion and those living in northern latitudes where the sun\u2019s rays are not as strong, are deficient in vitamin D. In cases of deficiency, a doctor can prescribe a vitamin D supplement."}
{"prompt":"Question: A solute generally does what to the freezing point of a solvent?\nOptions:\n A. lowers it\nB. regulates it\nC. raises it\nD. increases it","completion":"lowers it\nExplanation: A solute generally lowers the freezing point of a solvent, which is called freezing point depression.

{"prompt":"Question: Which artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone?\nOptions:\n A. atrial artery\nB. external carotid\nC. venal artery\nD. internal carotid artery","completion":"internal carotid artery\nExplanation: The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone. A second set of vessels that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through the foramen magnum of the occipital bone. Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into the anterior spinal artery supplying the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, found along the anterior median fissure. The two vertebral arteries then merge into the basilar artery, which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum. The left and right internal carotid arteries and branches of the basilar artery all become the circle of Willis, a confluence of arteries that can maintain perfusion of the brain even if narrowing or a blockage limits flow through one part (Figure 13.15)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the type of plant that has a single cotelydon in the seedling?\nOptions:\n A. monocot\nB. dicot\nC. conifer\nD. moss","completion":"monocot\nExplanation: Monocots Plants in the monocot group are primarily identified as such by the presence of a single cotyledon in the seedling. Other anatomical features shared by monocots include veins that run parallel to the length of the leaves, and flower parts that are arranged in a three- or six-fold symmetry. True woody tissue is rarely found in monocots. In palm trees, vascular and parenchyma tissues produced by the primary and secondary thickening meristems form the trunk. The pollen from the first angiosperms was monosulcate, containing a single furrow or pore through the outer layer. This feature is still seen in the modern monocots. Vascular tissue of the stem is not arranged in any particular pattern. The root system is mostly adventitious and unusually positioned, with no major tap root. The monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies (which are at the origin of their alternate name of Liliopsida), orchids, grasses, and palms. Many important crops are monocots, such as rice and other cereals, corn, sugar cane, and tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples (Figure 26.17)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Coxal glands collect liquid waste from what?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. blood\nC. plasma\nD. heart","completion":"blood\nExplanation: Some arthropods have special excretory structures. They are called coxal glands and Malpighian tubules . Coxal glands collect and concentrate liquid waste from blood. They excrete the waste from the body through a pore. Malphigian tubules carry waste from the digestive tract to the anus. The waste is excreted through the anus."}
{"prompt":"Question: A goiter is a visible indication of deficiency of what?\nOptions:\n A. iodine\nB. arsenic\nC. chlorine\nD. water","completion":"iodine\nExplanation: Endocrine System: Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and Hyperthyroidism As discussed above, dietary iodine is required for the synthesis of T3 and T4. But for much of the world\u2019s population, foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used. Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high levels because they concentrate iodine from seawater, but many people in landlocked regions lack access to seafood. Thus, the primary source of dietary iodine in many countries is iodized salt. Fortification of salt with iodine began in the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the world\u2019s poorest nations continue today. Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T3 and T4, leading to a variety of severe disorders. When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 17.14). A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth and development, decreased fertility, and prenatal and infant death. Moreover, iodine deficiency is the primary cause of preventable mental retardation worldwide. Neonatal hypothyroidism (cretinism) is characterized by cognitive deficits, short stature, and sometimes deafness and muteness in children and adults born to mothers who were iodinedeficient during pregnancy."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards called?\nOptions:\n A. parallax\nB. calibration\nC. distortion\nD. precision","completion":"calibration\nExplanation: When using measuring devices, we often use a technique called calibration to increase the accuracy of our measurements. Calibration is a method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. To better understand calibration, we will look at the example of calibrating a thermometer. All thermometers are slightly different in their temperature readings. One way to calibrate a thermometer is by using the freezing point and boiling point of water ( Figure below ). If we know that water freezes at 0\u00b0C and boils at 100\u00b0C, we can calibrate our thermometer by measuring the temperature of ice water and of boiling water. We place the thermometer in ice water and wait for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, then place a mark at this height which represents 0\u00b0C. Then we place the thermometer in boiling water, and after waiting for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, we place a mark at this height which represents 100\u00b0C. We can then place 100 equally spaced divisions between our 0 and 100\u00b0C marks to each represent 1\u00b0C. Our thermometer has now been calibrated using the known values for the freezing point and boiling point of water, and can be used to measure temperatures of objects between 0 and 100\u00b0C."}
{"prompt":"Question: What causes light to refract?\nOptions:\n A. slowing down\nB. speeding up\nC. blinking\nD. bending","completion":"slowing down\nExplanation: Light slows down when it enters water from the air. This causes the wave to refract, or bend."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for when the phenotype of offspring is partly determined by the phenotype of its mother, irrespective of genotype?\nOptions:\n A. maternal effect\nB. congenital effect\nC. uterine effect\nD. oceanic effect","completion":"maternal effect\nExplanation: Gap genes themselves are under the effect of maternal effect genes, such as bicoid and nanos. Gap genes also regulate each other to achieve their precise striped expression patterns. The maternal effect is when the phenotype of offspring is partly determined by the phenotype of its mother, irrespective of genotype. This often occurs when the mother supplies mRNA or proteins to the egg, affecting early development. In developing Drosophila, maternal effects include axis determination."}

{"prompt":"Question: Shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin, called what?\nOptions:\n A. heterotroph scales\nB. hook scales\nC. pinworm scales\nD. placoid scales","completion":"placoid scales\nExplanation: Chondrichthyes: Cartilaginous Fishes The clade Chondrichthyes is diverse, consisting of sharks (Figure 29.11), rays, and skates, together with sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called chimaeras, or \u201cghost\u201d sharks. \u201d Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage. This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian. They are thought to be descended from the placoderms, which had skeletons made of bone; thus, the cartilaginous skeleton of Chondrichthyes is a later development. Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of calcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone. Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. Most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces. Shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin, called placoid scales. Some species of sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton."}

{"prompt":"Question: What's the term for the gradual progression from simple plants to larger more complex ones in an area?\nOptions:\n A. complex progression\nB. primary succession\nC. pattern progression\nD. primary pattern","completion":"primary succession\nExplanation: The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession."}
{"prompt":"Question: How do dogs lose body heat?\nOptions:\n A. barking\nB. panting\nC. sweating\nD. eating","completion":"panting\nExplanation: One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the skin. This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That\u2019s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure below ). Evaporation of water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat uses heat and helps cool the body."}

{"prompt":"Question: Cancer involves what changes that modify cell-cycle control and alter the growth rate or progression of the cell through the cell cycle?\nOptions:\n A. deletions\nB. enhancements\nC. stabilization\nD. mutations","completion":"mutations\nExplanation: 16.7 | Cancer and Gene Regulation By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe how changes to gene expression can cause cancer \u2022 Explain how changes to gene expression at different levels can disrupt the cell cycle \u2022 Discuss how understanding regulation of gene expression can lead to better drug design Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don\u2019t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein. For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer."}

{"prompt":"Question: Grasses such as wheat, rice, and corn are examples of fibrous root systems. fibrous root systems are found in monocots; tap root systems are found in these?\nOptions:\n A. mosses\nB. monocots\nC. gymnosperms\nD. dicots","completion":"dicots\nExplanation: has a single main root that grows down. A fibrous root system forms a dense network of roots that is closer to the soil surface. An example of a tap root system is a carrot. Grasses such as wheat, rice, and corn are examples of fibrous root systems. Fibrous root systems are found in monocots; tap root systems are found in dicots. 37 Monocots have leaves with parallel venation, and dicots have leaves with reticulate, net-like venation. 39 The process of bulk flow moves water up the xylem and moves photosynthates (solutes) up and down the phloem. 41 Gravitropism will allow roots to dig deep into the soil to find water and minerals, whereas the seedling will grow towards light to enable photosynthesis. 43 To prevent further entry of pathogens, stomata close, even if they restrict entry of CO2. Some pathogens secrete virulence factors that inhibit the closing of stomata. Abscisic acid is the stress hormone responsible for inducing closing of stomata."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of a resource is soil, for human purposes?\nOptions:\n A. nonrenewable resource\nB. renewable resource\nC. guarana resource\nD. emanates resource","completion":"nonrenewable resource\nExplanation: Although renewable, soil takes a very long time to form\u2014up to hundreds of millions of years. So, for human purposes, soil is a nonrenewable resource. It is also constantly depleted of nutrients through careless use, and eroded by wind and water. For example, misuse of soil caused a huge amount of it to simply blow away in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl (see Figure below ). Soil must be used wisely to preserve it for the future. Conservation practices include contour plowing and terracing. Both reduce soil erosion. Soil also must be protected from toxic wastes."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are metals and good electrical conductors that tend to lose their valence electrons in chemical reactions called?\nOptions:\n A. reductants\nB. stable metals\nC. conservants\nD. precious metals","completion":"reductants\nExplanation: Electronegativity Differences between Metals and Nonmetals An element\u2019s electronegativity provides us with a single value that we can use to characterize the chemistry of an element. Elements with a high electronegativity (\u03c7 \u2265 2.2 in Figure 7.15 \"Pauling Electronegativity Values of the \") have very negative affinities and large ionization potentials, so they are generally nonmetals and electrical insulators that tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions (i. , they are oxidants). In contrast, elements with a low electronegativity (\u03c7 \u2264 1.8) have electron affinities that have either positive or small negative values and small ionization potentials, so they are generally metals and good electrical conductors that tend to lose their valence electrons in chemical reactions (i. , they are reductants). In between the metals and nonmetals, along the heavy diagonal line running from B to At in Figure 1.24 \"The Periodic Table Showing the Elements in Order of Increasing \", is a group of elements with intermediate electronegativities (\u03c7 ~ 2.0). These are the semimetals, elements that have some of the chemical properties of both nonmetals and metals. The distinction between metals and nonmetals is."}
{"prompt":"Question: Like a house, your body has what kind of mechanism that responds to changes in temperature?\nOptions:\n A. external thermostat\nB. mechanical thermostat\nC. internal thermostat\nD. sensitive thermostat","completion":"internal thermostat\nExplanation: For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way. When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot, the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate. This response helps decrease body temperature."}
{"prompt":"Question: Mineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect what balance, by regulating sodium and water levels?\nOptions:\n A. blood pressure\nB. osmotic\nC. homeostasis\nD. equilibrium","completion":"osmotic\nExplanation: Mineralocorticoids Mineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids. In contrast, the aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption. In contrast, absence of aldosterone means that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine. In addition, the daily dietary potassium load is not secreted and the retention of K+ can cause a dangerous increase in plasma K+ concentration. Patients who have Addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose sodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are particles that feel the strong nuclear force called?\nOptions:\n A. bosons\nB. mesons\nC. baryons\nD. hadrons","completion":"hadrons\nExplanation: Hadrons and Leptons Particles can also be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by gravity, since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. The proton, neutron, and the pions are examples of hadrons. The electron, positron, muons, and neutrinos are examples of leptons, the name meaning low mass. Leptons feel the weak nuclear force. In fact, all particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Table 33.2 lists the characteristics of some of the most important subatomic particles, including the directly observed carrier particles for the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, all leptons, and some hadrons. Several hints related to an underlying substructure emerge from an examination of these particle characteristics. Note that the carrier particles are called gauge bosons. First mentioned in Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization, a boson is a particle with zero or an integer value of intrinsic spin (such as s = 0, 1, 2, . ), whereas a fermion is a particle with a half-integer value of intrinsic spin (."}

{"prompt":"Question: What property allows cut logs to float on water?\nOptions:\n A. polarity\nB. density\nC. heat\nD. precipitation","completion":"density\nExplanation: After trees are cut, logging companies often move these materials down a river to a sawmill where they can be shaped into building materials or other products. The logs float on the water because they are less dense than the water they are in. Knowledge of density is important in the characterization and separation of materials. Information about density allows us to make predictions about the behavior of matter."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of variation does a rate measure?\nOptions:\n A. property to time\nB. environment to time\nC. value to time\nD. construction to time","completion":"property to time\nExplanation: A rate is a measure of how some property varies with time. Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time. The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution\u2019s conductivity. For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. If we measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution, we find that it changes slowly over time as the H2O2 decomposes, according to the equation: 2H 2 O 2(aq) \u27f6 2H 2 O(l) + O 2(g) The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here: change in concentration of reactant time interval \u23a1 \u23a4 \u23a1 \u23a4 \u2212 \u23a3H 2 O 2\u23a6 t \u23a3H 2 O 2\u23a6 t 1 2 = \u2212 t2 \u2212 t1."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the first direct action of growth hormone?\nOptions:\n A. stimulation of monoglyceride breakdown\nB. stimulation of monoglyceride production\nC. stimulation of triglyceride breakdown\nD. stimulation of triglyceride production","completion":"stimulation of triglyceride breakdown\nExplanation: Hormonal Regulation of Growth Hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body. Growth hormone (GH), produced by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and bones. Growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action. The first direct action of GH is stimulation of triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes. This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids. This process is called a glucose-sparing effect. In another direct mechanism, GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose. Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs. The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus. The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins, which are a family of growth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth. IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells, and other target cells, as shown in Figure 37.13. This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are high in the blood. GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. GH release is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also called somatostatin."}
{"prompt":"Question: Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to expand but are constrained from doing so\u2014which is equivalent to compressing them to less than their normal volume. this often occurs when a contained material warms up, since most materials expand when they do this?\nOptions:\n A. increase temperature\nB. increase density\nC. increase mass\nD. decrease temperature","completion":"increase temperature\nExplanation: Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to expand but are constrained from doing so\u2014which is equivalent to compressing them to less than their normal volume. This often occurs when a contained material warms up, since most materials expand when their temperature increases. If the materials are tightly constrained, they deform or break their container. Another very common example occurs when water freezes. Water, unlike most materials, expands when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a biological cell, or crack an engine block that gets in its way. Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave analogously to the tension, shear, and bulk deformations considered here."}

All animals are eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, and almost all animals have specialized tissues. Most animals are motile, at least during certain life stages. Animals require a source of food to grow and develop. All animals are heterotrophic, ingesting living or dead organic matter. This form of obtaining energy distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which make their own nutrients through photosynthesis and from fungi that digest their food externally. Animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, or parasites (Figure 15.2). Most animals reproduce sexually: The offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined body plan, unlike plants, for example, in which the exact shape of the body is indeterminate. The body plan refers to the shape of an animal."}

The main reason is that they contain chloroplasts and produce food through photosynthesis. However, they lack many other structures of true plants. For example, algae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. Some algae also differ from plants in being motile. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. Although not plants themselves, algae were probably the ancestors of plants."}
{"prompt":"Question: What determines the length and thickness of dna chromosomes?\nOptions:\n A. degree of rna coiling\nB. type of dna\nC. degree of dna coiling\nD. number of chromosomes","completion":"degree of dna coiling\nExplanation: The degree of DNA coiling determines whether the chromosome strands are short and thick or long and thin. Between cell divisions, the DNA in chromosomes is more loosely coiled and forms long thin strands called chromatin . DNA is in this uncoiled form during the majority of the cell cycle, making the DNA available to the proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription. Before the cell divides, the chromatin coils up more tightly and form chromosomes. Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to be seen under a microscope. The word chromosome comes from the Greek word chroma (color), and soma (body) due to its ability to be stained strongly by dyes."}

Prairie dog actions improve the quality of soil and water for plants, upon which most other species in the community depend."}
{"prompt":"Question: What material is regularly used in human hip and knee implants?\nOptions:\n A. wood\nB. glass\nC. coal\nD. metal","completion":"metal\nExplanation: Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most implants need to be replaced over time because, among other things, metal does not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings that would allow metalto-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has an expansion coefficient similar to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing process lead to cracks at the coating-metal interface. Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can expand differently from tooth enamel. It can give pain when eating ice cream or having a hot drink. Cracks might occur in the filling. Metal fillings (gold, silver, etc. ) are being replaced by composite fillings (porcelain), which have smaller coefficients of expansion, and are closer to those of teeth."}

{"prompt":"Question: What molecules with a nitrogen base are the basic components of nucleic acids?\nOptions:\n A. nucleiotides\nB. sporozoans\nC. enzymes\nD. nuclides","completion":"nucleiotides\nExplanation: The basic components of nucleic acids are nucleotides. A nucleotide is a molecule that contains a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen containing base. The five-carbon sugar is either ribose, in the case of RNA, or deoxyribose, in the case of DNA. The only difference between the two molecules is the presence of a hydroxyl group attached to one member of the carbon ring in RNA. In DNA, that same carbon atom is attached only to a hydrogen atom (see Figure below ). Note that in drawing the structure of organic molecules, the single hydrogen atoms are not shown in the structure but are understood to be attached at each carbon point unless another molecule is shown."}

{"prompt":"Question: In humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of what?\nOptions:\n A. organ\nB. neuron\nC. membrane\nD. receptor","completion":"receptor\nExplanation: In humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction, each receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What organ absorbs about 90 percent of the water you ingest?\nOptions:\n A. skin\nB. small intestine\nC. lungs\nD. large intestine","completion":"small intestine\nExplanation: Absorption, Feces Formation, and Defecation The small intestine absorbs about 90 percent of the water you ingest (either as liquid or within solid food). The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water, a process that converts the liquid chyme residue into semisolid feces (\u201cstool\u201d). Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old epithelial cells from the GI mucosa, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of the body. Of every 500 mL (17 ounces) of food residue that enters the cecum each day, about 150 mL (5 ounces) become feces. Feces are eliminated through contractions of the rectal muscles. You help this process by a voluntary procedure called Valsalva\u2019s maneuver, in which you increase intra-abdominal pressure by contracting your diaphragm and abdominal wall muscles, and closing your glottis. The process of defecation begins when mass movements force feces from the colon into the rectum, stretching the rectal wall and provoking the defecation reflex, which eliminates feces from the rectum. This parasympathetic reflex is mediated by the spinal cord. It contracts the sigmoid colon and rectum, relaxes the internal anal sphincter, and initially contracts the external anal sphincter. The presence of feces in the anal canal sends a signal to the brain, which gives you the choice of voluntarily opening the external anal sphincter (defecating) or keeping it temporarily closed. If you decide to delay defecation, it takes a few seconds for the reflex contractions to stop and the rectal walls to relax. The next mass movement will trigger additional defecation reflexes until you defecate. If defecation is delayed for an extended time, additional water is absorbed, making the feces firmer and potentially leading to constipation. On the other hand, if the waste matter moves too quickly through the intestines, not enough water is absorbed, and diarrhea can result. This can be caused by the ingestion of foodborne pathogens. In general, diet, health, and stress determine the frequency of bowel movements. The number of bowel movements varies greatly between individuals, ranging from two or three per day to three or four per week."}

The strongest bases, such as drain cleaner, have a pH value close to 14."}
{"prompt":"Question: What secures teeth in the mouth?\nOptions:\n A. plug\nB. socket\nC. muscles\nD. cartilage","completion":"socket\nExplanation: Anatomy of a Tooth The teeth are secured in the alveolar processes (sockets) of the maxilla and the mandible. Gingivae (commonly called the gums) are soft tissues that line the alveolar processes and surround the necks of the teeth. Teeth are also held in their sockets by a connective tissue called the periodontal ligament. The two main parts of a tooth are the crown, which is the portion projecting above the gum line, and the root, which is embedded within the maxilla and mandible. Both parts contain an inner pulp cavity, containing loose connective tissue through which run nerves and blood vessels. The region of the pulp cavity that runs through the root of the tooth is called the root canal. Surrounding the pulp cavity is dentin, a bone-like tissue. In the root of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an even harder bone-like layer called cementum. In the crown of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an outer layer of enamel, the hardest substance in the body (Figure 23.11). Although enamel protects the underlying dentin and pulp cavity, it is still nonetheless susceptible to mechanical and chemical erosion, or what is known as tooth decay. The most common form, dental caries (cavities) develops when colonies of bacteria feeding on sugars in the mouth release acids that cause soft tissue inflammation and degradation of the calcium crystals of the enamel. The digestive functions of the mouth are summarized in Table 23.4."}

Evidence for this is the bilateral symmetry of their larvae."}
{"prompt":"Question: What percentage of men suffer from some form of erectile dysfunction by age 40?\nOptions:\n A. approximately 60 percent\nB. approximately 10 percent\nC. approximately 80 percent\nD. approximately 40 percent","completion":"approximately 40 percent\nExplanation: Male Reproductive System Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection. The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate, and complete ED is approximately 40 percent in men at age 40, and reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease, psychiatric disorders, prostate disorders, the use of some drugs such as certain antidepressants, and problems with the testes resulting in low testosterone concentrations. These physical and emotional conditions can lead to interruptions in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection. Recall that the release of NO induces relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, leading to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur. PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the 1990s, clinical trials of a PDE5 inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris (chest pain caused by poor blood flow through the heart). The trial showed that the drug was not effective at treating heart conditions, but many men experienced erection and priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours). Because of this, a clinical trial was started to investigate the ability of sildenafil to promote erections in men suffering from ED. In 1998, the FDA approved the drug, marketed as Viagra\u00ae. Since approval of the drug, sildenafil and similar PDE inhibitors now generate over a billion dollars a year in sales, and are reported to be effective in treating approximately 70 to 85 percent of cases of ED. Importantly, men with health problems\u2014especially those with cardiac disease taking nitrates\u2014should avoid Viagra or talk to their physician to find out if they are a candidate for the use of this drug, as deaths have been reported for at-risk users."}

{"prompt":"Question: A phospholipid is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and what else?\nOptions:\n A. chlorine molecule\nB. elemental molecule\nC. phosphorous molecule\nD. oxygen molecule","completion":"phosphorous molecule\nExplanation: Phospholipids As its name suggests, a phospholipid is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule. In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar \u201chead\u201d region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom."}

{"prompt":"Question: A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of what eye structure?\nOptions:\n A. iris\nB. retina\nC. scelra\nD. pupil","completion":"retina\nExplanation: Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual field. This may appear similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but the difference is that the patient is asked to not move the eyes while the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field. Here, the extent of movement is the point of the test. The examiner is watching for conjugate movements representing proper function of the related nuclei and the MLF. Failure of one eye to abduct while the other adducts in a horizontal movement is referred to as internuclear ophthalmoplegia. When this occurs, the patient will experience diplopia, or double vision, as the two eyes are temporarily pointed at different stimuli. Diplopia is not restricted to failure of the lateral rectus, because any of the extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in perfect conjugation with the other. The final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen in toward the patient\u2019s face. As visual stimuli move closer to the face, the two medial recti muscles cause the eyes to move in the one nonconjugate movement that is part of gaze control. When the two eyes move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which is referred to as convergence. To keep the stimulus in focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens, which is controlled through the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. The change in focal power of the eye is referred to as accommodation. Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book or on a computer screen, may require corrective lenses later in life. Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence and coordination of the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are referred to as the accommodation\u2013convergence reflex. A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) coordinates all of the components (Figure 16.10), both sensory and motor, that make this possible. If the head rotates in one direction\u2014for example, to the right\u2014the horizontal pair of semicircular canals in the inner ear indicate the movement by increased activity on the right and decreased activity on the left. The information is sent to the abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on either side to coordinate the lateral and medial rectus muscles. The left lateral rectus and right medial rectus muscles will contract, rotating the eyes in the opposite direction of the head, while nuclei controlling the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles will be inhibited to reduce antagonism of the contracting muscles."}

Their genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the chromosomes found in all their cells and the alleles that are passed down from their parents. Their phenotype is the expression of that genotype, based on the interaction of the paired alleles, as well as how environmental conditions affect that expression. Working with pea plants, Mendel discovered that the factors that account for different traits in parents are discretely transmitted to offspring in pairs, one from each parent. He articulated the principles of random segregation and independent assortment to account for the inheritance patterns he observed. Mendel\u2019s factors are genes, with differing variants being referred to as alleles and those alleles being dominant or recessive in expression. Each parent passes one allele for every gene on to offspring, and offspring are equally likely to inherit any combination of allele pairs. When Mendel crossed heterozygous individuals, he repeatedly found a 3:1 dominant\u2013recessive ratio. He correctly postulated that the expression of the recessive trait was masked in heterozygotes but would resurface in their offspring in a predictable manner. Human genetics focuses on identifying different alleles and understanding how they express themselves. Medical researchers are especially interested in the identification of inheritance patterns for genetic disorders, which provides the means to estimate the risk that a given couple\u2019s offspring will inherit a genetic disease or disorder. Patterns of inheritance in humans include autosomal dominance and recessiveness, X-linked dominance and recessiveness, incomplete dominance, codominance, and lethality. A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, which may or may not manifest in a phenotype, is called a mutation."}

{"prompt":"Question: Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape held together by chemical interactions. if the protein is subject to changes in temperature, ph, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what is known as this?\nOptions:\n A. denaturation\nB. extraction\nC. fermentation\nD. gastrulation","completion":"denaturation\nExplanation: Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what is known as denaturation as discussed earlier. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure is preserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen when an egg is fried or boiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan, changing from a clear substance to an opaque white substance. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that are adapted to function at those temperatures."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the greek word meaning \"to help make things easier\"?\nOptions:\n A. toy\nB. battery\nC. machine\nD. mode","completion":"machine\nExplanation: 9.5 Simple Machines Simple machines are devices that can be used to multiply or augment a force that we apply \u2013 often at the expense of a distance through which we apply the force. The word for \u201cmachine\u201d comes from the Greek word meaning \u201cto help make things easier. \u201d Levers, gears, pulleys, wedges, and screws are some examples of machines. Energy is still conserved for these devices because a machine cannot do more work than the energy put into it. However, machines can reduce the input force that is needed to perform the job. The ratio of output to input force magnitudes for any simple machine is called its mechanical advantage (MA)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What determines sex in animals?\nOptions:\n A. sex chromosomes\nB. cell structure\nC. ribosomes\nD. cell density","completion":"sex chromosomes\nExplanation: Sex chromosomes determine sex in animals and many plants.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells?\nOptions:\n A. cell membrane\nB. cell wall\nC. tight junction\nD. placental barrier","completion":"tight junction\nExplanation: A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 3.17b). Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space. Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 3.17c). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles. Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 3.17d). Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ."}
{"prompt":"Question: When a balloon is rubbed against hair, why do they attract each other?\nOptions:\n A. constantly electron charge\nB. lean electron charge\nC. opposite electron charge\nD. same electron charge","completion":"opposite electron charge\nExplanation: Electrons are transferred from hair to a balloon rubbed against the hair.

{"prompt":"Question: What weather term describes what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account?\nOptions:\n A. windshield\nB. freezing point\nC. humidity\nD. windchill","completion":"windchill\nExplanation: Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends on air temperature and wind speed ( Figure below ). Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isn't blowing."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of earthquake creates a tsunami?\nOptions:\n A. Tectonic\nB. collapse\nC. underwater\nD. volcanic","completion":"underwater\nExplanation: An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: the movement of the crust displaces water. The displacement forms a set of waves. The waves travel at jet speed through the ocean. Since the waves have low amplitudes and long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water. As the waves reach shore they compress. They are also pushed upward by the shore. For these reasons, tsunamis can grow to enormous wave heights. Tsunami waves can cause tremendous destruction and loss of life. Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunamis."}
{"prompt":"Question: A ramp is an example of what?\nOptions:\n A. move plane\nB. change plane\nC. level plane\nD. inclined plane","completion":"inclined plane\nExplanation: A ramp like the one in the Figure below is another example of an inclined plane. Inclined planes make it easier to move objects to a higher elevation. The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. You can see several other examples of inclined planes at this URL:."}
{"prompt":"Question: Because fungi feed on decaying and dead matter, they play what important role by releasing essential elements into the environment?\nOptions:\n A. producers\nB. decomposers\nC. carnivores\nD. consumers","completion":"decomposers\nExplanation: CHAPTER SUMMARY 24.1 Characteristics of Fungi Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that appeared on land more than 450 million years ago. They are heterotrophs and contain neither photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, nor organelles such as chloroplasts. Because fungi feed on decaying and dead matter, they are saprobes. Fungi are important decomposers that release essential elements into the environment. External enzymes digest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus, which is called a thallus. A thick cell wall made of chitin surrounds the cell. Fungi can be unicellular as yeasts, or develop a network of filaments called a mycelium, which is often described as mold. Most species multiply by asexual and sexual reproductive cycles and display an alternation of generations. Another group of fungi do not have a sexual cycle. Sexual reproduction involves plasmogamy (the fusion of the cytoplasm), followed by karyogamy (the fusion of nuclei). Meiosis regenerates haploid individuals, resulting in haploid spores."}
{"prompt":"Question: What external feature in human beings is responsible for balance?\nOptions:\n A. tails\nB. brain\nC. ears\nD. hands","completion":"ears\nExplanation: The ears are also responsible for the sense of balance. Balance is the ability to sense and maintain body position. The semicircular canals inside the ear (see Figure above ) contain fluid that moves when the head changes position. Tiny hairs lining the semicircular canals sense movement of the fluid. In response, they send nerve impulses to the vestibular nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and sends messages to the peripheral nervous system. This system maintains the body\u2019s balance by triggering contractions of skeletal muscles as needed."}

{"prompt":"Question: What property is defined as the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions?\nOptions:\n A. distance\nB. gravity\nC. Distance\nD. passing","completion":"distance\nExplanation: Distance Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not. Distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions. Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m. Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks."}

{"prompt":"Question: Water molecules move about continuously due to what type of energy?\nOptions:\n A. seismic\nB. potential\nC. kinetic\nD. optical","completion":"kinetic\nExplanation: Water molecules move about continuously due to their kinetic energy. When a crystal of sodium chloride is placed into water, the water\u2019s molecules collide with the crystal lattice. Recall that the crystal lattice is composed of alternating positive and negative ions. Water is attracted to the sodium chloride crystal because water is polar and has both a positive and a negative end. The positively charged sodium ions in the crystal attract the oxygen end of the water molecules because they are partially negative. The negatively charged chloride ions in the crystal attract the hydrogen end of the water molecules because they are partially positive. The action of the polar water molecules takes the crystal lattice apart (see image below)."}
{"prompt":"Question: The size of the solute particles determines the rate of what?\nOptions:\n A. dissolving\nB. merging\nC. extracting\nD. solution","completion":"dissolving\nExplanation: The rate at which a solute dissolves depends upon the size of the solute particles. Dissolving is a surface phenomenon since it depends on solvent molecules colliding with the outer surface of the solute. A given quantity of solute dissolves faster when it is ground into small particles than if it is in the form of a large chunk because more surface area is exposed. The packet of granulated sugar exposes far more surface area to the solvent and dissolves more quickly than the sugar cube."}

{"prompt":"Question: What organ interprets what our sensory organs sense?\nOptions:\n A. nerves\nB. lungs\nC. brain\nD. thyroid","completion":"brain\nExplanation: Sensory neurons in each sense organ receive stimuli, or messages from the environment that cause a response in the body. For example, sensory neurons in the eyes send messages to the brain about light. Sensory neurons in the skin send messages to the brain about touch. Our sense organs recognize sensations, but they don\u2019t tell us what we are sensing. For example, when you breathe in chemicals given off by baking cookies, your nose does not tell you that you are smelling cookies. That\u2019s your brain\u2019s job. The sense organs send messages about sights, smells, and other stimuli to the brain ( Figure below ). The brain then reads the messages and tells you what they mean. A certain area of the brain receives and interprets information from each sense organ. For example, information from the nose is received and interpreted by the temporal lobe of the cerebrum."}

Some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely almost exclusively on sexual reproduction. Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents. Flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants. With their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and sizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs. Other plants pollinate via wind or water; still others self-pollinate."}

{"prompt":"Question: Prokaryotes divide via binary fission and do not undergo what process of cell division?\nOptions:\n A. prophase\nB. mitosis\nC. meiosis\nD. fusion","completion":"mitosis\nExplanation: Reproduction Reproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission. Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote exists as a single, circular chromosome. Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis. Rather the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms."}
{"prompt":"Question: The most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual these?\nOptions:\n A. fibers\nB. atoms\nC. cells\nD. spores","completion":"spores\nExplanation: The most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual spores, which are produced by one parent only (through mitosis) and are genetically identical to that parent (Figure 24.8). Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments. They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium."}

{"prompt":"Question: Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened, thus telomere shortening is associated with what life process?\nOptions:\n A. metabolism\nB. reducing\nC. aging\nD. reproduction","completion":"aging\nExplanation: Telomerase and Aging Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older. In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in [2] regenerative medicine. Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem 2.

{"prompt":"Question: What happens when chemical bonds in a burning log break?\nOptions:\n A. remove heat\nB. hold heat\nC. release heat\nD. decrease heat","completion":"release heat\nExplanation: Energy is a measure of the amount of or potential for movement in something. The total amount of energy in the universe is always the same. This symmetry is called a conservation law. Conservation of energy is one of five conservation laws that govern our universe. A group of things (we\u2019ll use the word system ) has a certain amount of energy. Energy can be added to a system; for instance, when chemical bonds in a burning log break, they release heat. Energy can be lost from a system; for instance, when a spacecraft \u201cburns up\u201d its energy of motion during re-entry, it loses energy and the surrounding atmosphere gains the lost energy. A closed system is one for which the total energy does not change, or is conserved . In this chapter, we will often consider closed systems, for which the total amount of energy stays the same, but transforms from one kind to another. The transfer of energy from one system to another is called Work . Work is equal to the amount of energy transferred in (positive work) or out (negative work) of a system. Work is equal to the distance the object is moved multiplied by the amount of force in the direction of its motion. The rate at which work is done is called Power ."}

{"prompt":"Question: Snake venom may join the class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents, which can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal what?\nOptions:\n A. brain\nB. clot\nC. bleed\nD. bone","completion":"clot\nExplanation: on a daily basis as a preventive measure. However, aspirin can also lead to serious side effects, including increasing the risk of ulcers. A patient is well advised to consult a physician before beginning any aspirin regimen. A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal clot. If a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patient\u2019s prognosis improves significantly. However, some strokes are not caused by thrombi, but by hemorrhage. Thus, the cause must be determined before treatment begins. Tissue plasminogen activator is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the primary enzyme that breaks down clots. It is released naturally by endothelial cells but is also used in clinical medicine. New research is progressing using compounds isolated from the venom of some species of snakes, particularly vipers and cobras, which may eventually have therapeutic value as thrombolytic agents."}

This is beneficial to the plant because it can continue to grow even when the tip of the plant is removed by grazing or mowing. 29 Stomata allow gases to enter and exit the plant. Guard cells regulate the opening and closing of stomata. If these cells did not function correctly, a plant could not get the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis, nor could it release the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. 31 In woody plants, the cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem; it produces new cells towards the interior, which enables the plant to increase in girth. The cork cambium also produces cork cells towards the exterior, which protect the plant from physical damage while reducing water loss. 33 Annual rings can also indicate the climate conditions that prevailed during each growing season. 35 A tap root system."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term means the minimum energy required in order for a collision between molecules to result in a chemical reaction?\nOptions:\n A. maximum energy\nB. solar energy\nC. activation energy\nD. depletion energy","completion":"activation energy\nExplanation: Summary A minimum energy (activation energy, Ea) is required for a collision between molecules to result in a chemical reaction. Plots of potential energy for a system versus the reaction coordinate show an energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to occur. The arrangement of atoms at the highest point of this barrier is the activated complex, or transition state, of the reaction. At a given temperature, the higher the Ea, the slower the reaction. The fraction of orientations that result in a reaction is the steric factor. The frequency factor, steric factor, and activation energy are related to the rate constant in the Arrhenius equation: \u00a0k = Ae - Ea \/ RT. A plot of the natural logarithm of k versus 1\/T is a straight line with a slope of \u2212Ea\/R. Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the study of the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions called?\nOptions:\n A. inorganic chemistry\nB. analytical chemistry\nC. electrochemistry\nD. physical chemistry","completion":"electrochemistry\nExplanation: Summary Electrochemistry is the study of the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions. The oxidation\u2013reduction reaction that occurs during an electrochemical process consists of two halfreactions, one representing the oxidation process and one the reduction process. The sum of the halfreactions gives the overall chemical reaction. The overall redox reaction is balanced when the number of electrons lost by the reductant equals the number of electrons gained by the oxidant. An electric current is produced from the flow of electrons from the reductant to the oxidant. An electrochemical cell can either generate electricity from a spontaneous redox reaction or consume electricity to drive a nonspontaneous reaction. In a galvanic (voltaic) cell, the energy from a spontaneous reaction generates electricity, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is consumed to drive a nonspontaneous redox reaction. Both types of cells use two electrodes that provide an electrical connection between systems that are separated in space. The oxidative half-reaction occurs at the anode, and the reductive half-reaction occurs at the cathode. A salt bridge connects the separated solutions, allowing ions to migrate to either solution to ensure the system\u2019s electrical neutrality. A voltmeter is a device that measures the flow of electric current between two half-reactions. The potential of a cell, measured in volts, is the energy needed to move a charged particle in an electric field. An electrochemical cell can be described using line notation called a cell diagram, in which vertical lines indicate phase boundaries and the location of the salt bridge. Resistance to the flow of charge at a boundary is called the junction potential."}

These peripheral proteins anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton, effectively forming a molecular complex that joins together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. The major types anchoring proteins of tight junctions are the claudins and the occludins."}
{"prompt":"Question: Within the microsporangium, the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores, each of which will ultimately form this?\nOptions:\n A. pollen grain\nB. zygote\nC. sperm cell\nD. ova","completion":"pollen grain\nExplanation: Within the microsporangium, the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores, each of which will ultimately form a pollen grain (Figure 32.7). An inner layer of cells, known as the tapetum, provides nutrition to the developing microspores and contributes key components to the pollen wall. Mature pollen grains contain two cells: a generative cell and a pollen tube cell. The generative cell is contained within the larger pollen tube cell. Upon germination, the tube cell forms the pollen tube through which the generative cell migrates to enter the ovary. During its transit inside the pollen tube, the generative cell divides to form two male gametes (sperm cells). Upon maturity, the microsporangia burst, releasing the pollen grains from the anther."}

{"prompt":"Question: During the typical human female ovulation cycles, how many eggs are released?\nOptions:\n A. four\nB. two\nC. three\nD. one","completion":"one\nExplanation: The Zygote Recall that at the point of fertilization, the oocyte has not yet completed meiosis; all secondary oocytes remain arrested in metaphase of meiosis II until fertilization. Only upon fertilization does the oocyte complete meiosis. The unneeded complement of genetic material that results is stored in a second polar body that is eventually ejected. At this moment, the oocyte has become an ovum, the female haploid gamete. The two haploid nuclei derived from the sperm and oocyte and contained within the egg are referred to as pronuclei. They decondense, expand, and replicate their DNA in preparation for mitosis. The pronuclei then migrate toward each other, their nuclear envelopes disintegrate, and the male- and femalederived genetic material intermingles. This step completes the process of fertilization and results in a single-celled diploid zygote with all the genetic instructions it needs to develop into a human. Most of the time, a woman releases a single egg during an ovulation cycle. However, in approximately 1 percent of ovulation cycles, two eggs are released and both are fertilized. Two zygotes form, implant, and develop, resulting in the."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the sequence of elementary steps that together comprise an entire chemical reaction called?\nOptions:\n A. reaction mechanism\nB. reaction circle\nC. mechanical mechanism\nD. basic reaction","completion":"reaction mechanism\nExplanation: The overall balanced equation for a chemical reaction does not always tell us how a reaction actually proceeds. In many cases, the overall reaction takes place in a series of small steps. An elementary step (or elementary reaction) is one step in a series of simple reactions that show the progress of a reaction at the molecular level. In terms of collision theory, each elementary step corresponds to a single collision. A reaction mechanism is the sequence of elementary steps that together comprise an entire chemical reaction. As an analogy, consider the route that you might take while driving to the grocery store. That route may consist of several turns, similar to the elementary steps. The overall reaction specifies only the beginning point (your house) and the final destination (the store), with no information about the specifics in between."}
{"prompt":"Question: About one-fourth of the blood pumped with each heartbeat enters arteries serving what organs of digestion?\nOptions:\n A. stomach\nB. bowels\nC. intestines\nD. lungs","completion":"intestines\nExplanation: Blood Supply The blood vessels serving the digestive system have two functions. They transport the protein and carbohydrate nutrients absorbed by mucosal cells after food is digested in the lumen. Lipids are absorbed via lacteals, tiny structures of the lymphatic system. The blood vessels\u2019 second function is to supply the organs of the alimentary canal with the nutrients and oxygen needed to drive their cellular processes. Specifically, the more anterior parts of the alimentary canal are supplied with blood by arteries branching off the aortic arch and thoracic aorta. Below this point, the alimentary canal is supplied with blood by arteries branching from the abdominal aorta. The celiac trunk services the liver, stomach, and duodenum, whereas the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries supply blood to the remaining small and large intestines. The veins that collect nutrient-rich blood from the small intestine (where most absorption occurs) empty into the hepatic portal system. This venous network takes the blood into the liver where the nutrients are either processed or stored for later use. Only then does the blood drained from the alimentary canal viscera circulate back to the heart. To appreciate just how demanding the digestive process is on the cardiovascular system, consider that while you are \u201cresting and digesting,\u201d about one-fourth of the blood pumped with each heartbeat enters arteries serving the intestines."}

{"prompt":"Question: Since the electric field lines point radially away from the charge, they are perpendicular to what?\nOptions:\n A. singularity lines\nB. archetypical lines\nC. equipotential lines\nD. magnetic field lines","completion":"equipotential lines\nExplanation: 19.4 Equipotential Lines We can represent electric potentials (voltages) pictorially, just as we drew pictures to illustrate electric fields. Of course, the two are related. Consider Figure 19.8, which shows an isolated positive point charge and its electric field lines. Electric field lines radiate out from a positive charge and terminate on negative charges. While we use blue arrows to represent the magnitude and direction of the electric field, we use green lines to represent places where the electric potential is constant. These are called equipotential lines in two dimensions, or equipotential surfaces in three dimensions. The term equipotential is also used as a noun, referring to an equipotential line or surface. The potential for a point charge is the same anywhere on an imaginary sphere of radius r surrounding the charge. This is true since the potential for a point charge is given by V = kQ \/ r and, thus, has the same value at any point that is a given distance r from the charge. An equipotential sphere is a circle in the two-dimensional view of Figure 19.8. Since the electric field lines point radially away from the charge, they are perpendicular to the equipotential lines."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is another common term for single-unit smooth muscle?\nOptions:\n A. abnormal muscle\nB. lateral muscle\nC. energies muscle\nD. visceral muscle","completion":"visceral muscle\nExplanation: Smooth muscle is organized in two ways: as single-unit smooth muscle, which is much more common; and as multiunit smooth muscle. The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics. Single-unit muscle has its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. This type of smooth muscle is found in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart (which has cardiac muscle in its walls), and so it is commonly called visceral muscle. Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the organization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres, visceral smooth muscle has a stress-relaxation response. This means that as the muscle of a hollow organ is stretched when it fills, the mechanical stress of the stretching will trigger contraction, but this is immediately followed by relaxation so that the organ does not empty its contents prematurely. This is important for hollow organs, such as the stomach or urinary bladder, which continuously expand as they fill. The smooth muscle around these organs also can maintain a muscle tone when the organ empties and shrinks, a feature that prevents \u201cflabbiness\u201d in the empty organ. In general, visceral smooth muscle produces slow, steady contractions that allow substances, such as food in the digestive tract, to move through the body. Multiunit smooth muscle cells rarely possess gap junctions, and thus are not electrically coupled. As a result, contraction does not spread from one cell to the next, but is instead confined to the cell that was originally stimulated. Stimuli for multiunit smooth muscles come from autonomic nerves or hormones but not from stretching. This type of tissue is found around large blood vessels, in the respiratory airways, and in the eyes."}

{"prompt":"Question: Convection generally involves the transfer of what type of energy?\nOptions:\n A. sunlight\nB. thermal\nC. radioactive\nD. magnetic","completion":"thermal\nExplanation: Convection currents transfer thermal energy through many fluids, not just hot water in a pot. For example, convection currents transfer thermal energy through molten rock below Earth\u2019s surface, through water in the oceans, and through air in the atmosphere. Convection currents in the atmosphere create winds. You can see one way this happens in the Figure below . The land heats up and cools off faster than the water because it has lower specific heat. Therefore, the land gets warmer during the day and cooler at night than the water does. During the day, warm air rises above the land and cool air from the water moves in to take its place. During the night, the opposite happens. Warm air rises above the water and cool air from the land moves out to take its place."}

{"prompt":"Question: The development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form this?\nOptions:\n A. gametophyte\nB. blastula\nC. multicell\nD. eukaryote","completion":"blastula\nExplanation: Cleavage and Blastula Stage The development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 43.24a). After the cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in Figure 43.24b. During cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells. Each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere."}
{"prompt":"Question: Electrons in inner shells are called what?\nOptions:\n A. core electrons\nB. inner electrons\nC. surface electrons\nD. valence electrons","completion":"core electrons\nExplanation: because of interactions between the electrons of the outermost shell of different atoms, called the valence shell electrons. Electrons in inner shells are called core electrons. Elements are grouped together by similar chemical properties into a chart called the periodic table. Vertical columns of elements are called groups or families. Some of the groups of elements have names, like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals, the halogens, and the noble gases. A horizontal row of elements is called a period. Periods and groups have differing numbers of elements in them. The periodic table separates elements into metals, nonmetals, andsemimetals. The periodic table is also separated into main group elements,transition metals, lanthanide elements, and actinide elements. The lanthanide and actinide elements are also referred to as inner transition metal elements. The shape of the periodic table reflects the sequential filling of shells and subshells in atoms. The periodic table helps us understand trends in some of the properties of atoms. One such property is the atomic radius of atoms. From top to bottom of the periodic table, atoms get bigger because electrons are occupying larger and bigger shells. From left to right across the periodic table, electrons are filling the same shell but are being attracted by an increasing positive charge from the nucleus, and thus the atoms get smaller."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the general shape of centrioles?\nOptions:\n A. rod\nB. spherical\nC. arc\nD. oval","completion":"rod\nExplanation: Centrioles are rod-like structures made of short microtubules.

{"prompt":"Question: Rubber is an example of what type of substances that do not allow electrons to move through them?\nOptions:\n A. conductor\nB. semi-conductor\nC. solids\nD. insulators","completion":"insulators\nExplanation: A common method of producing charge in the lab is to rub cat or rabbit fur against stiff rubber, producing a negative charge on the rubber rod. If you hold a rubber rod on one end and rub only the tip of the other end with a fur, you will find that only the tip becomes charged. The electrons you add to the tip of the rod remain where you put them instead of moving around on the rod. Rubber is an insulator. Insulators are substances that do not allow electrons to move through them. Glass, dry wood, most plastics, cloth, and dry air are common insulators. Materials that allow electrons to flow freely are called conductors. Metals have at least one electron that can move around freely, and all metals are conductors."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the measure of water potential?\nOptions:\n A. trials\nB. fluctuations\nC. spores\nD. megapascals","completion":"megapascals\nExplanation: Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water. Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems. In practical terms, therefore, water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature). Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter \u03c8 (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure (pressure is a form of energy) called megapascals (MPa). The potential of pure water (\u03a8wpure H2O) is, by convenience of definition, designated a value of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored). Water potential values for the water in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to \u03a8 wpure H2O. The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix effects. Water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation:."}

{"prompt":"Question: Increasing the pressure on a gas has what effect on its solubility?\nOptions:\n A. increase\nB. decrease\nC. halt\nD. slow","completion":"increase\nExplanation: The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the outer layer of skin?\nOptions:\n A. endodermis\nB. hypodermis\nC. the dermis\nD. the epidermis","completion":"the epidermis\nExplanation: The epidermis is the outer layer of skin, consisting of epithelial cells and little else (see Figure below ). For example, there are no nerve endings or blood vessels in the epidermis. The innermost cells of the epidermis are continuously dividing through mitosis to form new cells. The newly formed cells move up through the epidermis toward the skin surface, while producing a tough, fibrous protein called keratin . The cells become filled with keratin and die by the time they reach the surface, where they form a protective, waterproof layer called the stratum corneum . The dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the skin and replaced by other cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term refers to the balance, or equilibrium, within the cell or a body, and an organism\u2019s ability to keep a constant internal environment?\nOptions:\n A. homeostasis\nB. metabolism\nC. ketosis\nD. consciousness","completion":"homeostasis\nExplanation: Homeostasis refers to the balance, or equilibrium, within the cell or a body. It is an organism\u2019s ability to keep a constant internal environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the normal level or range). Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes discussed in both the Diffusion and Active Transport concepts all play an important role in homeostatic regulation. You will learn more about homeostasis in other concepts."}
{"prompt":"Question: What part of blood releases clotting factors?\nOptions:\n A. hemoglobin\nB. platelets\nC. white blood cells\nD. erythrocytes","completion":"platelets\nExplanation: Platelets ( Figure below ) are very small, but they are very important in blood clotting. Platelets are not cells. They are sticky little pieces of larger cells. Platelets bud off large cells that stay in the bone marrow. When a blood vessel gets cut, platelets stick to the injured areas. They release chemicals called clotting factors, which cause proteins to form over the wound. This web of proteins catches red blood cells and forms a clot. This clot stops more blood from leaving the body through the cut blood vessel. The clot also stops bacteria from entering the body. Platelets survive in the blood for ten days before they are removed by the liver and spleen."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have called?\nOptions:\n A. liquid\nB. plasma\nC. fluid\nD. solid","completion":"plasma\nExplanation: You\u2019re probably less familiar with plasmas than with solids, liquids, and gases. Yet, most of the universe consists of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have. Like a gas, plasma lacks a fixed volume and shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetism. That\u2019s because plasma contains charged particles called ions. This gives plasma other interesting properties. For example, it glows with light."}
{"prompt":"Question: In science, what is constantly tested, sometimes revised, sometimes thrown out and sometimes well-established?\nOptions:\n A. a technique\nB. a study\nC. a theory\nD. a variable","completion":"a theory\nExplanation: A theory is constantly tested. If some data does not agree with the theory, the theory can be revised. If the theory cannot match the data, it is thrown out.

{"prompt":"Question: Each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the what?\nOptions:\n A. tube nucleus\nB. intine\nC. pollen tube\nD. cytoplasm","completion":"intine\nExplanation: Each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine (Figure 32.7). The exine contains sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage. Female Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac) While the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. First, in the process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangium\u2014an area of tissue in the ovules\u2014undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei\u2014the polar nuclei\u2014move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells (Figure 32.8). The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of cell has negative anode is positive cathode?\nOptions:\n A. picric cell\nB. voltaic cell\nC. planetoid cell\nD. non-voltaic cell","completion":"voltaic cell\nExplanation: The standard cell potential is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous reaction. The battery must be capable of delivering at least 1.10 V of direct current in order for the reaction to occur. Another difference between a voltaic cell and an electrolytic cell is the signs of the electrodes. In a voltaic cell, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive. In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positive because it is connected to the positive terminal of the battery. The cathode is therefore negative. Electrons still flow through the cell form the anode to the cathode."}
{"prompt":"Question: What asymmetrical organ has four chambers and, in humans, is about the size of a clenched fist?\nOptions:\n A. brain\nB. kidney\nC. liver\nD. heart","completion":"heart\nExplanation: Structure of the Heart The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 40.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals."}

{"prompt":"Question: What force explains why objects may float in water?\nOptions:\n A. warm force\nB. cool force\nC. gravity force\nD. buoyant force","completion":"buoyant force\nExplanation: What explains buoyant force? Recall from the earlier lesson \"Pressure of Fluids\" that a fluid exerts pressure in all directions but the pressure is greater at greater depth. Therefore, the fluid below an object exerts greater force on the object than the fluid above the object. This is illustrated in Figure below . Buoyant force explains why objects may float in water. No doubt you\u2019ve noticed, however, that some objects do not float in water. If buoyant force applies to all objects in fluids, why do some objects sink instead of float? The answer has to do with their weight."}

Flatworms also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry."}
{"prompt":"Question: Respiration rate correlates with what?\nOptions:\n A. size\nB. heat\nC. energy use\nD. pressure","completion":"energy use\nExplanation: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis."}

{"prompt":"Question: The simplest example of what type of 'organ system' is the gastrovascular cavity found in organisms with only one opening for the process?\nOptions:\n A. cardiovascular\nB. digestive\nC. respiratory\nD. nervous","completion":"digestive\nExplanation: Invertebrate Digestive Systems Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the \u201cmouth\u201d, which also serves as an \u201canus\u201d. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity. The alimentary canal, shown in Figure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus."}

{"prompt":"Question: What part of the ear is often described as a bony labyrinth?\nOptions:\n A. embedded ear\nB. inner ear\nC. solid ear\nD. outer ear","completion":"inner ear\nExplanation: The inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the temporal bone. It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles. However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve. Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window. The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli. The scala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the cochlea that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time travelling under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure 14.6). The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the scala tympani."}

{"prompt":"Question: In the universe as a whole, what is the most common element?\nOptions:\n A. helium\nB. carbon\nC. oxygen\nD. hydrogen","completion":"hydrogen\nExplanation: Abundance The elements vary widely in abundance. In the universe as a whole, the most common element is hydrogen (about 90% of atoms), followed by helium (most of the remaining 10%). All other elements are present in relatively minuscule amounts, as far as we can detect. On the planet Earth, however, the situation is rather different. Oxygen makes up 46.1% of the mass of Earth\u2019s crust (the relatively thin layer of rock forming Earth\u2019s surface), mostly in combination with other elements, while silicon makes up 28.5%. Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, makes up only 0.14% of Earth\u2019s crust. Table 2.1 \"Elemental Composition of Earth\" lists the relative abundances of elements on Earth as a whole and in Earth\u2019s crust. Table 2.2 \"Elemental Composition of a Human Body\" lists the relative abundances of elements in the human body.

{"prompt":"Question: About 95 percent of lipids are absorbed in what organ of the digestive system?\nOptions:\n A. small intestine\nB. kidneys\nC. stomach\nD. large intestine","completion":"small intestine\nExplanation: Lipid Absorption About 95 percent of lipids are absorbed in the small intestine. Bile salts not only speed up lipid digestion, they are also essential to the absorption of the end products of lipid digestion. Short-chain fatty acids are relatively water soluble and can enter the absorptive cells (enterocytes) directly. Despite being hydrophobic, the small size of short-chain fatty acids enables them to be absorbed by enterocytes via simple diffusion, and then take the same path as monosaccharides and amino acids into the blood capillary of a villus. The large and hydrophobic long-chain fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are not so easily suspended in the watery intestinal chyme. However, bile salts and lecithin resolve this issue by enclosing them in a micelle, which is a tiny sphere with polar (hydrophilic) ends facing the watery environment and hydrophobic tails turned to the interior, creating a receptive environment for the long-chain fatty acids. The core also includes cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. Without micelles, lipids would sit on the surface of chyme and never come in contact with the absorptive surfaces of the epithelial cells. Micelles can easily squeeze between microvilli and get very near the luminal cell surface. At this point, lipid substances exit the micelle and are absorbed via simple diffusion. The free fatty acids and monoacylglycerides that enter the epithelial cells are reincorporated into triglycerides. The triglycerides are mixed with phospholipids and cholesterol, and surrounded with a protein coat. This new complex, called a chylomicron, is a water-soluble lipoprotein. After being processed by the Golgi apparatus, chylomicrons are released from the cell (Figure 23.33). Too big to pass through the basement membranes of blood capillaries, chylomicrons instead enter the large pores of lacteals. The lacteals come together to form the lymphatic vessels. The chylomicrons are transported in the lymphatic vessels and empty through the thoracic duct into the subclavian vein of the circulatory system. Once in the bloodstream, the enzyme lipoprotein lipase breaks down the triglycerides of the chylomicrons into free fatty acids and glycerol. These breakdown products then pass through capillary walls to be used for energy by cells or stored in adipose tissue as fat. Liver cells combine the remaining chylomicron remnants with proteins, forming lipoproteins that transport cholesterol in the blood."}
{"prompt":"Question: Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery does what to the current?\nOptions:\n A. blocks it\nB. increases it\nC. stops it\nD. decreases it","completion":"increases it\nExplanation: Ohm\u2019s law may be easier to understand with an analogy. Current flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery increases the current. This is like opening the tap wider so more water flows through the hose. Increasing resistance reduces the current. This is like stepping on the hose so less water can flow through it.

Perpendicular to it is the intermediate internal oblique, extending superiorly and medially, the direction the thumbs usually go when the other fingers are in the pants pocket. The deep muscle, the transversus abdominis, is arranged transversely around the abdomen, similar to the front of a belt on a pair of pants. This arrangement of three bands of muscles in different orientations allows various movements and rotations of the trunk. The three layers of muscle also help to protect the internal abdominal organs in an area where there is no bone. The linea alba is a white, fibrous band that is made of the bilateral rectus sheaths that join at the anterior midline of the body. These enclose the rectus abdominis muscles (a pair of long, linear muscles, commonly called the \u201csit-up\u201d muscles) that originate at the pubic crest and symphysis, and extend the length of the body\u2019s trunk. Each muscle is segmented by three transverse bands of collagen fibers called the tendinous intersections. This results in the look of \u201csix-pack abs,\u201d as each segment hypertrophies on individuals at the gym who do many sit-ups. The posterior abdominal wall is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, parts of the ilia of the hip bones, psoas major and iliacus muscles, and quadratus lumborum muscle. This part of the core plays a key role in stabilizing the rest of the body and maintaining posture."}

{"prompt":"Question: The separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. nuclei crystallization\nB. simplest crystallization\nC. fractional crystallization\nD. separate crystallization","completion":"fractional crystallization\nExplanation: Solubility may increase or decrease with temperature; the magnitude of this temperature dependence varies widely among compounds. Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (\u0394Hsoln = +25.7 kJ\/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (\u0394Hsoln = \u221268.2 kJ\/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80\u00b0C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0\u00b0C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80\u00b0C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0\u00b0C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0\u00b0C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g \u2212 36 g) of Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole. leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called this?\nOptions:\n A. sheath leaves\nB. globular leaves\nC. transverse leaves\nD. sessile leaves","completion":"sessile leaves\nExplanation: Structure of a Typical Leaf Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves. Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin.

{"prompt":"Question: What process of allows multicellular organisms to grow and repair themselves?\nOptions:\n A. proteins division\nB. atom split\nC. cell division\nD. DNA division","completion":"cell division\nExplanation: The process of cell division is how multicellular organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled organisms, asexual reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, whereas sexual reproduction produces a similar, but genetically unique offspring. In sexual reproduction, meiosis produces haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote ( Figure below ). In other words, a child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent. Look at the family in Figure below . The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents. The children, of course, result from sexual reproduction."}

A sigma bond (\u03c3 bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in an end-to-end fashion, with the electron density concentrated between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. A pi bond (\u03c0 bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a side-by-side fashion, with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms. Figure below shows the two types of bonding in C 2 H 4 . The sp 2 hybrid orbitals are orange and the p z orbital is green. Three sigma bonds are formed by each carbon atom with its hybrid orbitals. The pi bond is the \u201csecond\u201d bond of the double bond between the carbon atoms and is shown as an elongated blue lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule, which contains the six atoms and all of the sigma bonds."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the scientific name of the thighbone, the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body?\nOptions:\n A. fibula\nB. femur\nC. humerus\nD. tibia","completion":"femur\nExplanation: The femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the proximal end. At the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint. The patella, or kneecap, is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint. The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). It improves knee extension by reducing friction. The tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee. The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end. It is the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot. The fibula, or calf bone, parallels and articulates with the tibia. It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight. The fibula acts as a site for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a certain form of matter that has the same physical properties throughout?\nOptions:\n A. balance\nB. wave\nC. phase\nD. structure","completion":"phase\nExplanation: 8.5 End-of-Chapter Material Chapter Summary To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the following bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter. A phase is a certain form of matter that has the same physical properties throughout. Three phases are common: the solid, the liquid, and the gas phase. What determines the phase of a substance? Generally, the strength of the intermolecular interactions determines whether a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas under any particular conditions. Covalent network bonding is a very strong form of intermolecular interaction. Diamond is one example of a substance that has this intermolecular interaction. Ionic interactions, the forces of attraction due to oppositely charged ions, are also relatively strong. Covalent bonds are another type of interaction within molecules, but if the bonds are polar covalent bonds, then the unequal sharing of electrons can cause charge imbalances within molecules that cause interactions between molecules. These molecules are described as polar, and these interactions are called dipole-dipole interactions. A certain rather strong type of dipole-dipole interaction, involving a hydrogen atom, is called hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, equal sharing of electrons forms nonpolar covalent bonds, and the interactions between different molecules is less because the molecules are nonpolar. All substances have very weak dispersion forces (also called London forces) caused by the movement of electrons within the bonds themselves. In the solid phase, intermolecular interactions are so strong that they hold the individual atoms or molecules in place. In many solids, the regular three-dimensional arrangement of particles makes a crystal. In other solids, the irregular arrangement of particles makes an amorphous solid. In liquids, the intermolecular interactions are Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

Since gases all occupy the same volume on a per mole basis, the density of a particular gas is dependent on its molar mass. A gas with a small molar mass will have a lower density than a gas with a large molar mass. Gas densities are typically reported in g\/L. Gas density can be calculated from molar mass and molar volume."}
{"prompt":"Question: Plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea cells all have what feature that keeps them rigid that animal cells do not have?\nOptions:\n A. cytoplasm\nB. cell membrane\nC. cell walls\nD. plastids","completion":"cell walls\nExplanation: about how that occurs, in terms of membrane structure. If the influx of water continued unopposed, the membrane would eventually burst like an over-inflated balloon, killing the cell. One strategy to avoid this lethal outcome, adopted by a range of organisms, is to build a semi-rigid \u201ccell wall\u201d exterior to the plasma membrane (\u2192). The synthesis of this cell wall is based on the controlled assembly of macromolecules secreted by the cell through the process of exocytosis (see above). As water passes through the plasma membrane and into the cell (driven by osmosis), the plasma membrane is pressed up against the cell wall. The force exerted by the rigid cell wall on the membrane balances the force of water entering the cell. When the two forces are equal, the net influx of water into the cell stops. Conversely, if the [H2O]outside decreases, this pressure is reduced, the membrane moves away from the cell wall and, because they are only semi-rigid, the walls flex. It is this behavior that causes plants to wilt when they do not get enough water. These are passive behaviors, based on the structure of the cell wall; they are built into the wall as it is assembled. Once the cell wall has been built, a cell with a cell wall does not need to expend energy to resist osmotic effects. Plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea all have cell walls. A number of antibiotics work by disrupting the assembly of bacterial cell walls. This leaves the bacteria osmotically sensitive, water enters these cells until they burst and die.

{"prompt":"Question: A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. sulfate\nB. Fructose\nC. polysaccharide\nD. polymers","completion":"polysaccharide\nExplanation: Polysaccharides A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly- = \u201cmany\u201d). The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides. Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant\u2019s immediate energy needs, is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can also act as a source of food for humans and animals. The starch that is consumed by humans is broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose. Starch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by \u03b1 1-4 or \u03b1 1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond. As illustrated in Figure 3.9, amylose is starch formed by unbranched chains of glucose monomers (only \u03b1 1-4 linkages), whereas amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide (\u03b1 1-6 linkages at the branch points)."}

{"prompt":"Question: At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its what?\nOptions:\n A. spontaneous rate\nB. instantaneous rate\nC. immediate rate\nD. emitted rate","completion":"instantaneous rate\nExplanation: To obtain the tabulated results for this decomposition, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured every 6 hours over the course of a day at a constant temperature of 40 \u00b0C. Reaction rates were computed for each time interval by dividing the change in concentration by the corresponding time increment, as shown here for the first 6-hour period: \u2212\u0394[H 2 O 2] \u2212(0.500 mol\/L \u2212 1.000 mol\/L) = = 0.0833 mol L \u22121 h \u22121 \u0394t (6.00 h \u2212 0.00 h) Notice that the reaction rates vary with time, decreasing as the reaction proceeds. Results for the last 6-hour period yield a reaction rate of: \u2212\u0394[H 2 O 2] \u2212(0.0625 mol\/L \u2212 0.125 mol\/L) = = 0.0104 mol L \u22121 h \u22121 \u0394t (24.00 h \u2212 18.00 h) This behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \u201ctime zero,\u201d when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle\u2019s initial rate\u2014analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction\u2014would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes (t0). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment\u2014call it t1\u2014would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car\u2019s average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop (\u0394t). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates. The instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. If we plot the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of H2O2 at any time t is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 12.3). We can use calculus to evaluating the slopes of such tangent lines, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature?\nOptions:\n A. thermal expansion\nB. freezing\nC. thermal contraction\nD. atmospheric expansion","completion":"thermal expansion\nExplanation: The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion, the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. Hot air rises because its volume increases, which causes the hot air\u2019s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a buoyant (upward) force on the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and weather systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes. What are the basic properties of thermal expansion? First, thermal expansion is clearly related to temperature change. The greater the temperature change, the more a bimetallic strip will bend. Second, it depends on the material. In a thermometer, for example, the expansion of alcohol is much greater than the expansion of the glass containing it. What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As is discussed in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are closely packed together, but their kinetic energy (in the form of small, rapid vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average, between neighbors, and adds up to a larger size for the whole body. For most substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and an increase in temperature will increase the solid\u2019s size by a certain fraction in each dimension. Linear Thermal Expansion\u2014Thermal Expansion in One Dimension The change in length \u0394L is proportional to length and length is summarized in the equation."}

{"prompt":"Question: The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of what?\nOptions:\n A. resistance to change form\nB. resistance to flow\nC. ability to absorb flow\nD. adaptability to surroundings","completion":"resistance to flow\nExplanation: When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that water and gasoline flow freely. But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline, and other liquids that flow freely have a low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown in Figure 10.15, have higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Because heterotrophs cannot make their own food, what are they called?\nOptions:\n A. products\nB. destroyers\nC. consumers\nD. customers","completion":"consumers\nExplanation: Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it. For this reason, heterotrophs are also known as consumers . Consumers include all animals and fungi and many protists and bacteria. They consume either autotrophs or other heterotrophs. Heterotrophs show great diversity and may appear far more fascinating than producers. But heterotrophs are limited by their utter dependence on those autotrophs which originally made the food. If plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria vanished from Earth, animals, fungi, and other heterotrophs would soon disappear as well. All life requires a constant input of energy. Only autotrophs can transform that ultimate, solar source into the chemical energy in food which powers life, as shown in Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is said about the speed of rotation in systems that create tornadoes?\nOptions:\n A. it is magnetic\nB. it is unchanged\nC. it is fast\nD. it is slow","completion":"it is slow\nExplanation: There are several other examples of objects that increase their rate of spin because something reduced their moment of inertia. Tornadoes are one example. Storm systems that create tornadoes are slowly rotating. When the radius of rotation narrows, even in a local region, angular velocity increases, sometimes to the furious level of a tornado. Earth is another example. Our planet was born from a huge cloud of gas and dust, the rotation of which came from turbulence in an even larger cloud. Gravitational forces caused the cloud to contract, and the rotation rate increased as a result. (See Figure 10.24."}

{"prompt":"Question: According to the first law of thermodynamics, what can neither be created nor destroyed?\nOptions:\n A. fuel\nB. food\nC. energy\nD. light","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Chapter 46 1 Figure 46.8 According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Eventually, all energy consumed by living systems is lost as heat or used for respiration, and the total energy output of the system must equal the energy that went into it. 3 Figure 46.17 C: Nitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3\u2212) to nitrites (NO2\u2212). 4 D 6 B 8 A 10 D 12 D 14 B 16 A 18 A 20 C 21 Food webs show interacting groups of different species and their many interconnections with each other and the environment. Food chains are linear aspects of food webs that describe the succession of organisms consuming one another at defined trophic levels. Food webs are a more accurate representation of the structure and dynamics of an ecosystem. Food chains are easier to model and use for experimental studies. 23 Grazing food webs have a primary producer at their base, which is either a plant for terrestrial ecosystems or a phytoplankton for aquatic ecosystems. The producers pass their energy to the various trophic levels of consumers. At the base of detrital food webs are the decomposers, which pass this energy to a variety of other consumers. Detrital food webs are important for the health of many grazing food webs because they eliminate dead and decaying organic material, thus, clearing space for new organisms and removing potential causes of disease. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers also make mineral nutrients available to primary producers; this process is a vital link in nutrient cycling. 25 NPE measures the rate at which one trophic level can use and make biomass from what it attained in the previous level, taking into account respiration, defecation, and heat loss. Endotherms have high metabolism and generate a lot of body heat. Although this gives them advantages in their activity level in colder temperatures, these organisms are 10 times less efficient at harnessing the energy from the food they eat compared with cold-blooded animals, and thus have to eat more and more often. 27 Many factors can kill life in a lake or ocean, such as eutrophication by nutrient-rich surface runoff, oil spills, toxic waste spills, changes in climate, and the dumping of garbage into the ocean. Eutrophication is a result of nutrient-rich runoff from land using artificial fertilizers high in nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients cause the rapid and excessive growth of microorganisms, which deplete local dissolved oxygen and kill many fish and other aquatic organisms."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas?\nOptions:\n A. liquid black\nB. carbon black\nC. dioxide black\nD. dark black","completion":"carbon black\nExplanation: Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds; however, the forces between layers are weak. London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called \u201clead\u201d in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating \u03c0 bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite. Other forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, CH4. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air. Recently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccerball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, C60. This is buckminsterfullerene (often called bucky balls) after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a similar appearance (Figure 18.22)."}
{"prompt":"Question: A winter storm is called what?\nOptions:\n A. snow storm\nB. tempest\nC. gale\nD. blizzard","completion":"blizzard\nExplanation: A storm is an episode of severe weather caused by a major disturbance in the atmosphere. Storms can vary a lot in the time they last and in how severe they are. A storm may last for less than an hour or for more than a week. It may affect just a few square kilometers or thousands. Some storms are harmless and some are disastrous. The size and strength of a storm depends on the amount of energy in the atmosphere. Greater differences in temperature and air pressure produce stronger storms. Types of storms include thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter storms such as blizzards."}

{"prompt":"Question: Fusion is another nuclear process that can be used to produce energy. in this process, smaller nuclei are combined to make larger nuclei, with an accompanying release of this?\nOptions:\n A. food\nB. mineral\nC. energy\nD. cells","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Note The first controlled chain reaction was achieved on December 2, 1942, in an experiment supervised by Enrico Fermi in a laboratory underneath the football stadium at the University of Chicago. Although fairly simple in theory, an atomic bomb is difficult to produce, in part because uranium-235, the isotope that undergoes fission, makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium; the rest is mostly uranium-238, which does not undergo fission. (Remember that the radioactive process that a nucleus undergoes is characteristic of the isotope. ) To make uranium useful for nuclear reactors, the uranium in uranium-235 must be enriched to about 3%. Enrichment of uranium is a laborious and costly series of physical and chemical separations. To be useful in an atomic bomb, the uranium in uranium-235 must be enriched to 70% or more. At lesser concentrations, the chain reaction cannot sustain itself, so no explosion is produced. Fusion is another nuclear process that can be used to produce energy. In this process, smaller nuclei are combined to make larger nuclei, with an accompanying release of energy. One example is the hydrogen fusion, which makes helium. While the steps of the process are complicated, the net reaction is: 41H \u2192 4He + 2.58 \u00d7 1012 J Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: Velocity is a vector that has both direction and what?\nOptions:\n A. variable\nB. latitude\nC. magnitude\nD. radiation","completion":"magnitude\nExplanation: Because acceleration is velocity in m\/s divided by time in s, the SI units for acceleration are m\/s 2 , meters per second squared or meters per second per second, which literally means by how many meters per second the velocity changes every second. Recall that velocity is a vector\u2014it has both magnitude and direction. This means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in direction. For example, if a car turns a corner at constant speed, it is accelerating because its direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the acceleration. So there is an acceleration when velocity changes either in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or both. Acceleration as a Vector Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the change in velocity, \u0394v . Since velocity is a vector, it can change either in magnitude or in direction. Acceleration is therefore a change in either speed or direction, or both. Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of motion. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. This is known as deceleration."}

{"prompt":"Question: What property of an object is obtained by multiplying its mass and its velocity?\nOptions:\n A. fluid\nB. component\nC. momentum\nD. movement","completion":"momentum\nExplanation: When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he\u2019s going faster than skater 1 so he has more momentum. Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It\u2019s a product of the object\u2019s mass and velocity. At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same. In other words, momentum is conserved. This is the law of conservation of momentum ."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is produced during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils?\nOptions:\n A. trans fatty acids\nB. complete fatty acids\nC. rich fatty acids\nD. partially-hydrogenated fatty acids","completion":"trans fatty acids\nExplanation: taste, and nutrition of butter. (Preservatives and antioxidants are also added. ) In most commercial peanut butter, the peanut oil has been partially hydrogenated to prevent it from separating out. Consumers could decrease the amount of saturated fat in their diet by using the original unprocessed oils on their foods, but most people would rather spread margarine on their toast than pour oil on it. Many people have switched from butter to margarine or vegetable shortening because of concerns that saturated animal fats can raise blood cholesterol levels and result in clogged arteries. However, during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, an isomerization reaction occurs that produces the trans fatty acids mentioned in the opening essay. However, studies have shown that trans fatty acids also raise cholesterol levels and increase the incidence of heart disease. Trans fatty acids do not have the bend in their structures, which occurs in cis fatty acids and thus pack closely together in the same way that the saturated fatty acids do. Consumers are now being advised to use polyunsaturated oils and soft or liquid margarine and reduce their total fat consumption to less than 30% of their total calorie intake each day. Fats and oils that are in contact with moist air at room temperature eventually undergo oxidation and hydrolysis reactions that cause them to turn rancid, acquiring a characteristic disagreeable odor. One cause of the odor is the release of volatile fatty acids by hydrolysis of the ester bonds. Butter, for example, releases foul-smelling butyric, caprylic, and capric acids. Microorganisms present in the air furnish lipases that catalyze this process. Hydrolytic rancidity can easily be prevented by covering the fat or oil and keeping it in a refrigerator. Another cause of volatile, odorous compounds is the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acid components, particularly the readily oxidized structural unit."}

{"prompt":"Question: The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same what?\nOptions:\n A. class\nB. branch\nC. family\nD. farm","completion":"family\nExplanation: The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g\/cm3). The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H 2 O(l) \u27f6 2LiOH(aq) + H 2(g)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a sac-like organ  that stores urine?\nOptions:\n A. the colon\nB. the urinary liver\nC. the small intestine\nD. the urinary bladder","completion":"the urinary bladder\nExplanation: From the kidneys, urine enters the ureters. These are two muscular tubes that carry urine to the urinary bladder. Contractions of the muscles of the ureters move the urine along by peristalsis. The urinary bladder is a sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, a sphincter relaxes to let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body through another sphincter. The process of urine leaving the body is called urination. The second sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control."}
{"prompt":"Question: Pressure and vibration are examples of what type of stimuli?\nOptions:\n A. chemical\nB. physical\nC. atmospheric\nD. thermal","completion":"physical\nExplanation: Functional Receptor Types A third classification of receptors is by how the receptor transduces stimuli into membrane potential changes. Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds. Receptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object\u2019s taste or smell. Osmoreceptors respond to solute concentrations of body fluids. Additionally, pain is primarily a chemical sense that interprets the presence of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor. Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed through a thermoreceptor that is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body temperature."}

{"prompt":"Question: Mendel\u2019s observation of pea plants also included many crosses that involved multiple traits, which prompted him to formulate the principle of this?\nOptions:\n A. independent assortment\nB. independent contain\nC. independent texture\nD. dependent evolution","completion":"independent assortment\nExplanation: Mendel\u2019s observation of pea plants also included many crosses that involved multiple traits, which prompted him to formulate the principle of independent assortment. The law states that the members of one pair of genes (alleles) from a parent will sort independently from other pairs of genes during the formation of gametes. Applied to pea plants, that means that the alleles associated with the different traits of the plant, such as color, height, or seed type, will sort independently of one another. This holds true except when two alleles happen to be located close to one other on the same chromosome. Independent assortment provides for a great degree of diversity in offspring. Mendelian genetics represent the fundamentals of inheritance, but there are two important qualifiers to consider when applying Mendel\u2019s findings to inheritance studies in humans. First, as we\u2019ve already noted, not all genes are inherited in a dominant\u2013recessive pattern. Although all diploid individuals have two alleles for every gene, allele pairs may interact to create several types of inheritance patterns, including incomplete dominance and codominance. Secondly, Mendel performed his studies using thousands of pea plants. He was able to identify a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in second-generation offspring because his large sample size overcame the influence of variability resulting from chance. In contrast, no human couple has ever had thousands of children. If we know that a man and woman are both heterozygous for a recessive genetic disorder, we would predict that one in every four of their children would be affected by the disease. In real life, however, the influence of chance could change that ratio significantly. For example, if a man and a woman are both heterozygous for cystic fibrosis, a recessive genetic disorder that is expressed only when the individual has two defective alleles, we would expect one in four of their children to have cystic fibrosis. However, it is entirely possible for them to have seven children, none of whom is affected, or for them to have two children, both of whom are affected. For each individual child, the presence or absence of a single gene disorder depends on which alleles that child inherits from his or her parents."}

{"prompt":"Question: Unlike liver bile, 'juice' produced by what organ is clear and composed mostly of water along with some salts, sodium bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes?\nOptions:\n A. pancreas\nB. spleen\nC. gallbladder\nD. stomach","completion":"pancreas\nExplanation: Pancreatic Juice The pancreas produces over a liter of pancreatic juice each day. Unlike bile, it is clear and composed mostly of water along with some salts, sodium bicarbonate, and several digestive enzymes. Sodium bicarbonate is responsible for the slight alkalinity of pancreatic juice (pH 7.1 to 8.2), which serves to buffer the acidic gastric juice in chyme, inactivate pepsin from the stomach, and create an optimal environment for the activity of pH-sensitive digestive enzymes in the small intestine. Pancreatic enzymes are active in the digestion of sugars, proteins, and fats. The pancreas produces protein-digesting enzymes in their inactive forms. These enzymes are activated in the duodenum. If produced in an active form, they would digest the pancreas (which is exactly what occurs in the disease, pancreatitis). The intestinal brush border enzyme enteropeptidase stimulates the activation of trypsin from trypsinogen of the pancreas, which in turn changes the pancreatic enzymes procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen into their active forms, carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin. The enzymes that digest starch (amylase), fat (lipase), and nucleic acids (nuclease) are secreted in their active forms, since they do not attack the pancreas as do the protein-digesting enzymes."}
{"prompt":"Question: Spindle fibers pull what apart in anaphase i?\nOptions:\n A. known chromosomes\nB. risk chromosomes\nC. True Chromosomes\nD. linked chromosomes","completion":"linked chromosomes\nExplanation: In anaphase I, the spindle fibers pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere. It is the chiasma connections that are broken in anaphase I as the fibers attached to the fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart (Figure 7.5). In telophase I, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I. Cytokinesis, the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells, occurs without reformation of the nuclei in other organisms. In nearly all species, cytokinesis separates the cell contents by either a cleavage furrow (in animals and some fungi), or a cell plate that will ultimately lead to formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells (in plants). At each pole, there is just one member of each pair of the homologous chromosomes, so only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why the cells are considered haploid\u2014there is only one chromosome set, even though there are duplicate copies of the set because each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids that are still attached to each other. However, although the sister chromatids were once duplicates of the same chromosome, they are no longer identical at this stage because of crossovers."}

{"prompt":"Question: What fluid is most prevalent in your body?\nOptions:\n A. cold\nB. water\nC. liquid\nD. Coolant","completion":"water\nExplanation: Reporting Scientific Work Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Communication and collaboration within and between sub disciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a scientist\u2019s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed articles are scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist\u2019s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist\u2019s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists. There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of online openaccess journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which use rigorous peer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums without peer review are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientific work. In one exception, journals may allow a researcher to cite a personal communication from another researcher about unpublished results with the cited author\u2019s permission."}

{"prompt":"Question: What powerful microscopes use a beam of subatomic particles instead of a beam of light?\nOptions:\n A. complex microscopes\nB. scientific microscopes\nC. nuclear microscopes\nD. electron microscopes","completion":"electron microscopes\nExplanation: Electron Microscopes In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 3.3), it also provides higher resolving power. Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed using this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view living materials. In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell\u2019s surface, rendering the details of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like gold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details of a cell\u2019s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than are light microscopes."}

The shoot system includes the aboveground vegetative portions (stems and leaves) and reproductive parts (flowers and fruits). The root system supports the plant and is usually underground. A plant is composed of two main types of tissue: meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells found in root and shoot tips. As growth occurs, meristematic tissue differentiates into permanent tissue, which is categorized as either simple or complex. Simple tissues are made up of similar cell types; examples include dermal tissue and ground tissue. Dermal tissue provides the outer covering of the plant. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis; it also supports vascular tissue and may store water and sugars. Complex tissues are made up of different cell types. Vascular tissue, for example, is made up of xylem and phloem cells."}

{"prompt":"Question: What fluid becomes less viscous, allowing for better joint function after stretching?\nOptions:\n A. proximal\nB. vertebral\nC. cranial\nD. synovial","completion":"synovial\nExplanation: Exercise and Stretching When exercising, it is important to first warm up the muscles. Stretching pulls on the muscle fibers and it also results in an increased blood flow to the muscles being worked. Without a proper warm-up, it is possible that you may either damage some of the muscle fibers or pull a tendon. A pulled tendon, regardless of location, results in pain, swelling, and diminished function; if it is moderate to severe, the injury could immobilize you for an extended period. Recall the discussion about muscles crossing joints to create movement. Most of the joints you use during exercise are synovial joints, which have synovial fluid in the joint space between two bones. Exercise and stretching may also have a beneficial effect on synovial joints. Synovial fluid is a thin, but viscous film with the consistency of egg whites. When you first get up and start moving, your joints feel stiff for a number of reasons. After proper stretching and warm-up, the synovial fluid may become less viscous, allowing for better joint function."}

Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it present alone in the container (Figure 9.20). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressure. This observation is summarized by Dalton\u2019s law of partial pressures: The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases: P Total = P A + P B + P C + . = \u03a3 i P i In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of cells does meiosis produce?\nOptions:\n A. child cells\nB. diploid daughter cells\nC. mutated cells\nD. haploid daughter cells","completion":"haploid daughter cells\nExplanation: Meiosis is a special type of cell division. It produces haploid daughter cells. It occurs when an organism makes gametes. Meiosis is basically mitosis times two. The original diploid cell divides twice. The first time is called meiosis I. The second time is called meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates only once. It replicates before meiosis I but not before meiosis II. This results in four haploid daughter cells."}

{"prompt":"Question: As roots grow longer they will always do what?\nOptions:\n A. grow downward\nB. change direction\nC. get larger\nD. get thicker","completion":"grow downward\nExplanation: Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and width. As roots grow longer, they always grow down into the ground. Even if you turn a plant upside down, its roots will try to grow downward. How do roots \u201cknow\u201d which way to grow? How can they tell down from up? Specialized cells in root caps are able to detect gravity. The cells direct meristem in the tips of roots to grow downward toward the center of Earth. This is generally adaptive for land plants. Can you explain why?."}

{"prompt":"Question: Maltose, lactose, and sucrose are common types of what, which are distinguished by their monosaccharide constituents?\nOptions:\n A. silicates\nB. disaccharides\nC. oxides\nD. precipitates","completion":"disaccharides\nExplanation: The disaccharides differ from one another in their monosaccharide constituents and in the specific type of glycosidic linkage connecting them. There are three common disaccharides: maltose, lactose, and sucrose. All three are white crystalline solids at room temperature and are soluble in water. We\u2019ll consider each sugar in more detail."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does ubiquitin indicate about a protein's lifespan?\nOptions:\n A. completion\nB. initiation\nC. transaction\nD. reaction ratio","completion":"completion\nExplanation: Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell\u2014for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane. Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation\u2014all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications). The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.14). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are species that are first to colonize a disturbed area called?\nOptions:\n A. pioneer species\nB. novel species\nC. exploratory species\nD. brave species","completion":"pioneer species\nExplanation: The first species to colonize a disturbed area such as this are called pioneer species (see Figure below ). They change the environment and pave the way for other species to come into the area. Pioneer species are likely to include bacteria and lichens that can live on bare rock. Along with wind and water, they help weather the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. At first, the plants include grasses and other species that can grow in thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the electrode at which reduction occurs called?\nOptions:\n A. reducthode\nB. cathode\nC. anode\nD. cathine","completion":"cathode\nExplanation: The electrode at which reduction occurs is called the cathode .

{"prompt":"Question: All dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct at the end of which period?\nOptions:\n A. Tertiary\nB. cretaceous\nC. Jurassic\nD. Paleogene","completion":"cretaceous\nExplanation: At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What has the burning of fossil fuels increased in the atmosphere?\nOptions:\n A. ozone\nB. oxygen\nC. temperature\nD. carbon dioxide","completion":"carbon dioxide\nExplanation: Ocean water normally dissolves some of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, ocean water is also dissolving more carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a weak acid. With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. This process is called ocean acidification."}

{"prompt":"Question: Internal and external forms of what life process occur as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient?\nOptions:\n A. respiration\nB. reproduction\nC. metabolism\nD. photosynthesis","completion":"respiration\nExplanation: Internal Respiration Internal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external respiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient. However, the partial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg, because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about 100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood, cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue. Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its brightness, so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy in color. Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diffuse out of the tissue, cross the interstitial fluid, and enter the blood. It is then carried back to the lungs either bound to hemoglobin, dissolved in plasma, or in a converted form. By the time blood returns to the heart, the partial pressure of oxygen has returned to about 40 mm Hg, and the partial pressure."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of winds occur when air is forced over a mountain range?\nOptions:\n A. local winds\nB. chinook winds\nC. trade winds\nD. doldrums","completion":"chinook winds\nExplanation: Chinook winds ( Figure below ) occur when air is forced over a mountain range. Warm air rises over the Sierra Nevada in California, for example, because it is pushed eastward by the westerly winds. The air cools as it rises and precipitates. The air is now dry. It sinks down the far side of the mountains and may create strong winds. These Chinook winds are relatively warm. If there is snow, the winds may melt it quickly. The dry sinking air creates a rainshadow effect . Rainshadow effect is responsible for many of the world's deserts."}

{"prompt":"Question: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at what?\nOptions:\n A. midnight\nB. opposite times\nC. same time\nD. different times","completion":"same time\nExplanation: 28.2 Simultaneity And Time Dilation \u2022 Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time. They are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers\u2014simultaneity is not absolute. \u2022 Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer. \u2022 Observers moving at a relative velocity v do not measure the same elapsed time for an event. Proper time \u0394t 0 is the time measured by an observer at rest relative to the event being observed. Proper time is related to the time by an Earth-bound observer by the equation."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the scientific term for the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers, which led to the naming of an acid thought to play a role in the process?\nOptions:\n A. abscission\nB. ascorbition\nC. affixation\nD. ablation","completion":"abscission\nExplanation: Abscisic acid is misnamed because it was once believed to play a role in abscission (the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers), but we now know abscission is caused by ethylene. The actual role of abscisic acid is to close the stomata, the tiny openings in leaves that allow substances to enter and leave, and to maintain dormancy. When a plant is stressed due to lack of water, abscisic acid tells the stomata to close. This prevents water loss through the stomata."}
{"prompt":"Question: Another unit of energy, used widely in the health professions and everyday life, is _______?\nOptions:\n A. carbs\nB. body index\nC. biomass ( cal )\nD. calorie ( cal )","completion":"calorie ( cal )\nExplanation: example, if you hold an ice cube in your hand, the ice cube slowly melts as energy in the form of heat is transferred from your hand to the ice. As your hand loses energy, it starts to feel cold. Because of their interrelationships, energy, work, and heat have the same units. The SI unit of energy, work, and heat is the joule (J). A joule is a tiny amount of energy. For example, it takes about 4 J to warm 1 mL of H2O by 1\u00b0C. Many processes occur with energy changes in thousands of joules, so the kilojoule (kJ) is also common. Another unit of energy, used widely in the health professions and everyday life, is the calorie (cal). The calorie was initially defined as the amount of energy needed to warm 1 g of H2O by 1\u00b0C, but in modern times, the calorie is related directly to the joule, as follows: 1 cal = 4.184 J We can use this relationship to convert quantities of energy, work, or heat from one unit to another. The calorie is used in nutrition to express the energy content of foods. However, because a calorie is a rather small quantity, nutritional energies are usually expressed in kilocalories (kcal), also called Calories (capitalized; Cal). For example, a candy bar may provide 120 Cal (nutritional calories) of energy, which is equal to 120,000 cal. Proteins and carbohydrates supply 4 kcal\/g, while fat supplies 9 kcal\/g."}

{"prompt":"Question: Protozoa are generally difficult to identify due to what?\nOptions:\n A. their hidden shape\nB. their resting shape\nC. their varied shape\nD. their formation shape","completion":"their varied shape\nExplanation: 22.10 Protozoa As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms, like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies. Protozoa are generally difficult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a flattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2 \u03bcm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter. Furthermore, different protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has led certain organisms to be mistakenly classified for other species. Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classified based on their methods of locomotion. Characteristics of Protozoa : \u2022 About 30,000 species known \u2022 About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases \u2022 heterotrophic \u2022 highly variable in form and life cycle."}

{"prompt":"Question: Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at which level ?\nOptions:\n A. cranial\nB. vascular\nC. sacral\nD. peripheral","completion":"sacral\nExplanation: Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level (Figure 13.24). The cervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the posterior neck and head, as well as the phrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic cavity. The other plexus from the cervical level is the brachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is the radial nerve from which the axillary nerve branches to go to the armpit region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is paralleled by the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. The lumbar plexus arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. The femoral nerve is one of the major nerves from this plexus, which gives rise to the saphenous nerve as a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg. The sacral plexus comes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come from this plexus is the sciatic nerve, which is a combination of the tibial nerve and the fibular nerve. The sciatic nerve extends across the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the condition sciatica, which is the result of compression or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it. These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that some fibers extend from cutaneous or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal nerve root. Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve root and send action potentials to cause skeletal muscles to contract in their target regions. For example, the radial nerve contains fibers of cutaneous sensation in the arm, as well as motor fibers that move muscles in the arm. Spinal nerves of the thoracic region, T2 through T11, are not part of the plexuses but rather emerge and give rise to the intercostal nerves found between the ribs, which articulate with the vertebrae surrounding the spinal nerve."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of joints are capable of a wide range of movements, classified as gliding, angular, rotational, or special?\nOptions:\n A. glandular\nB. locking\nC. synovial\nD. fibrous","completion":"synovial\nExplanation: Movement at Synovial Joints The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. Gliding Movement Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones. The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce gliding movements. Angular Movement Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. There are several different types of angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases. Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. Extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as hyperextension. This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm. Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side. Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body. Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction. Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion, as in moving the arm in a circular motion."}
{"prompt":"Question: The atom often (but not always) turns into a different what during the decay process?\nOptions:\n A. concept\nB. reaction\nC. aspect\nD. element","completion":"element\nExplanation: When an atomic nucleus decays, it does so by releasing one or more particles. The atom often (but not always) turns into a different element during the decay process.

Big, rapidly decaying samples are most dangerous."}
{"prompt":"Question: Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in what type of motion?\nOptions:\n A. circular\nB. curving\nC. dynamic\nD. harmonic","completion":"harmonic\nExplanation: Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in harmonic motion. Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact of the initial source. In this sense waves are phenomena not objects."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells?\nOptions:\n A. radiation\nB. concussions\nC. hepatitis\nD. cancer","completion":"cancer\nExplanation: cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which type of diabetes is more common?\nOptions:\n A. gestational diabetes\nB. type 2\nC. juvenile diabetes\nD. type 1","completion":"type 2\nExplanation: Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can\u2019t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues?\nOptions:\n A. hydrostatic pressure\nB. temperature pressure\nC. constructs pressure\nD. isolate pressure","completion":"hydrostatic pressure\nExplanation: Hydrostatic Pressure The primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues is hydrostatic pressure, which can be defined as the pressure of any fluid enclosed in a space. Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the blood confined within blood vessels or heart chambers. Even more specifically, the pressure exerted by blood against the wall of a capillary is called capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood pressure. CHP is the force that drives fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues. As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly rises. This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Generally, the CHP originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continually absorbing excess fluid from the tissues. Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the interstitial fluid. This process is called filtration."}

What are possible outcomes of some of those mutations. Some can produce genetic disorder . A genetic disorder is a condition caused by abnormalities, such as mutations, in your genes or chromosomes. Genetic disorders are usually present from conception. These disorders include chromosomal abnormalities, in which the individual has too few or too many chromosomes or chromosomes with large alterations, or diseases due to a mutation in a specific gene. These defective genes are usually inherited from the parents, hence the term hereditary disease or genetic disorder. Genetic disorders can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner ( Figure below and Figure below ). Recessive disorders require the inheritance of a defective gene from each parent. The parents are usually unaffected and are healthy carriers of the defective gene."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where is roughage fermented and digested in pseudo-ruminants?\nOptions:\n A. in their ileum\nB. in their appendix\nC. in their cecum\nD. in their pancreas","completion":"in their cecum\nExplanation: Pseudo-ruminants Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a threechamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum."}
{"prompt":"Question: Nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins. atmospheric nitrogen, which is the diatomic molecule n2, or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in these?\nOptions:\n A. gas planets\nB. desert biomes\nC. aquatic ecosytems\nD. terrestrial ecosystems","completion":"terrestrial ecosystems\nExplanation: Nitrogen Fixation: Root and Bacteria Interactions Nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins. Atmospheric nitrogen, which is the diatomic molecule N2, or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms. However, nitrogen can be \u201cfixed,\u201d which means that it can be converted to ammonia (NH3) through biological, physical, or chemical processes. As you have learned, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria.

The variation of properties versus position on the periodic table is called periodic trends. There is no other tool in science that allows us to judge relative properties of a class of objects like this, which makes the periodic table a very useful tool. Many periodic trends are general. There may be a few points where an opposite trend is seen, but there is an overall trend when considered across a whole row or down a whole column of the periodic table. The first periodic trend we will consider atomic radius. The atomic radius is an indication of the size of an atom. Although the concept of a definite radius of an atom is a bit fuzzy, atoms behave as if they have a certain radius. Such radii can be estimated from various experimental techniques, such as the x-ray crystallography of crystals. As you go down a column of the periodic table, the atomic radii increase. This is because the valence electron shell is getting a larger and there is a larger principal quantum number, so the valence shell lies physically farther away from the nucleus. This trend can be summarized as follows:."}

The curved, inferior margin of the maxillary bone that forms the upper jaw and contains the upper teeth is the alveolar process of the maxilla (Figure 7.14). Each tooth is anchored into a deep socket called an alveolus. On the anterior maxilla, just below the orbit, is the infraorbital foramen. This is the point of exit for a sensory nerve that supplies the nose, upper lip, and anterior cheek. On the inferior skull, the palatine process from each maxillary bone can be seen joining together at the midline to form the anterior three-quarters of the hard palate (see Figure 7.8a). The hard palate is the bony plate that forms the roof of the mouth and floor of the nasal cavity, separating the oral and nasal cavities."}

{"prompt":"Question: Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in these?\nOptions:\n A. converts cells\nB. endogenous cells\nC. eukaryotic cells\nD. reproduction cells","completion":"eukaryotic cells\nExplanation: Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. They share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 11.7). Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo mitosis to form new diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one chromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid."}

{"prompt":"Question: One of the early signs of cell disease is this \"leaking\" of what into the body cells?\nOptions:\n A. sodium ions\nB. proteins\nC. potassium ions\nD. glucose","completion":"sodium ions\nExplanation: Potassium Concentration Glial cells, especially astrocytes, are responsible for maintaining the chemical environment of the CNS tissue. The concentrations of ions in the extracellular fluid are the basis for how the membrane potential is established and changes in electrochemical signaling. If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible. Normally the concentration of K+ is higher inside the neuron than outside. After the repolarizing phase of the action potential, K+ leakage channels and the Na+\/K+ pump ensure that the ions return to their original locations. Following a stroke or other ischemic event, extracellular K+ levels are elevated. The astrocytes in the area are equipped to clear excess K+ to aid the pump. But when the level is far out of balance, the effects can be irreversible. Astrocytes can become reactive in cases such as these, which impairs their ability to maintain the local chemical environment. The glial cells enlarge and their processes swell. They lose their K+ buffering ability and the function of the pump is affected, or even reversed. One of the early signs of cell disease is this \"leaking\" of sodium ions into the body cells. This sodium\/potassium imbalance negatively affects the internal chemistry of cells, preventing them from functioning normally."}

{"prompt":"Question: The vertebrae are divided into the cervical region, the thoracic region, and which other region?\nOptions:\n A. cylindrical region\nB. central region\nC. pelvic region\nD. lumbar region","completion":"lumbar region\nExplanation: 7.3 The Vertebral Column The vertebral column forms the neck and back. The vertebral column originally develops as 33 vertebrae, but is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into the cervical region (C1\u2013C7 vertebrae), the thoracic region (T1\u2013T12 vertebrae), and the lumbar region (L1\u2013L5 vertebrae). The sacrum arises from the fusion of five sacral vertebrae and the coccyx from the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae. The vertebral column has four curvatures, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacrococcygeal curves. The thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves are primary curves retained from the original fetal curvature. The cervical and lumbar curves develop after birth and thus are secondary curves. The cervical curve develops as the infant begins to hold up the head, and the lumbar curve appears with standing and walking. A typical vertebra consists of an enlarged anterior portion called the body, which provides weight-bearing support. Attached posteriorly to the body is a vertebral arch, which surrounds and defines the vertebral foramen for passage of the spinal cord. The vertebral arch consists of the pedicles, which attach to the vertebral body, and the laminae, which come together to form the roof of the arch. Arising from the vertebral arch are the laterally projecting transverse processes and the posteriorly oriented spinous process. The superior articular processes project upward, where they articulate with the downward projecting inferior articular processes of the next higher vertebrae. A typical cervical vertebra has a small body, a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous process, and U-shaped transverse processes with a transverse foramen. In addition to these characteristics, the axis (C2 vertebra) also has the dens projecting upward from."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the bulb called in the frontal lobe that processes smells?\nOptions:\n A. peripheral bulb\nB. olfactory bulb\nC. auditory bulb\nD. sensory bulb","completion":"olfactory bulb\nExplanation: The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in Figure 35.22. For example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand. Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decisionmaking. Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the muscular tube that carries urine out of the body?\nOptions:\n A. rectum\nB. uterus\nC. bladder\nD. urethra","completion":"urethra\nExplanation: From the collecting ducts of the kidneys, urine enters the ureters , two muscular tubes that move the urine by peristalsis to the bladder (see Figure above ). The bladder is a hollow, sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, it sends a nerve impulse to a sphincter to relax and let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body. Urine leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of urination . This sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control."}

{"prompt":"Question: What helps to regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states?\nOptions:\n A. hypothalamus\nB. thalamus\nC. hippocampus\nD. cerebral cortex","completion":"thalamus\nExplanation: Basal Ganglia Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in Figure 35.20b, play important roles in movement control and posture. Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson\u2019s disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation. For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody. But when he was externally stimulated\u2014as when someone asked to play a card game with him\u2014he was able to function normally. Interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state. Thalamus The thalamus (Greek for \u201cinner chamber\u201d), illustrated in Figure 35.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other symptoms, and is eventually fatal."}

{"prompt":"Question: The entry of food into the esophagus marks the beginning of the esophageal phase of deglutition and the initiation of this?\nOptions:\n A. relaxation\nB. digestion\nC. peristalsis\nD. propagation","completion":"peristalsis\nExplanation: The Esophageal Phase The entry of food into the esophagus marks the beginning of the esophageal phase of deglutition and the initiation of peristalsis. As in the previous phase, the complex neuromuscular actions are controlled by the medulla oblongata. Peristalsis propels the bolus through the esophagus and toward the stomach. The circular muscle layer of the muscularis contracts, pinching the esophageal wall and forcing the bolus forward. At the same time, the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis also contracts, shortening this area and pushing out its walls to receive the bolus. In this way, a series of contractions keeps moving food toward the stomach. When the bolus nears the stomach, distention of the esophagus initiates a short reflex relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter that allows the bolus to pass into the stomach. During the esophageal phase, esophageal glands secrete mucus that lubricates the bolus and minimizes friction."}

{"prompt":"Question: The nervous system is made up of these?\nOptions:\n A. fibers\nB. blood cells\nC. neurons\nD. muscles","completion":"neurons\nExplanation: Watch this video (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/vertebrate_evol) of biologist Mark Kirschner discussing the \u201cflipping\u201d phenomenon of vertebrate evolution. The nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire\u2014it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions of neurons. There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. There are four major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components."}
{"prompt":"Question: Superconductors are materials with a resistivity of?\nOptions:\n A. zero\nB. above zero\nC. greater density\nD. high magnitude","completion":"zero\nExplanation: 34.6 High-temperature Superconductors Superconductors are materials with a resistivity of zero. They are familiar to the general public because of their practical applications and have been mentioned at a number of points in the text. Because the resistance of a piece of superconductor is zero, there are no heat losses for currents through them; they are used in magnets needing high currents, such as in MRI machines, and could cut energy losses in power transmission. But most superconductors must be cooled to temperatures only a few kelvin above absolute zero, a costly procedure limiting their practical applications. In the past decade, tremendous advances have been made in producing materials that become superconductors at relatively high temperatures. There is hope that room temperature superconductors may someday be manufactured."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the name for the male reproductive organs or gonads?\nOptions:\n A. testes\nB. nucleus\nC. anus\nD. ovaries","completion":"testes\nExplanation: Testes The testes (singular = testis) are the male gonads\u2014that is, the male reproductive organs. They produce both sperm and androgens, such as testosterone, and are active throughout the reproductive lifespan of the male. Paired ovals, the testes are each approximately 4 to 5 cm in length and are housed within the scrotum (see Figure 27.3). They are surrounded by two distinct layers of protective connective tissue (Figure 27.4). The outer tunica vaginalis is a serous membrane that has both a parietal and a thin visceral layer. Beneath the tunica vaginalis is the tunica albuginea, a tough, white, dense connective tissue layer covering the testis itself. Not only does the tunica albuginea cover the outside of the testis, it also invaginates to form septa that divide the testis into 300 to 400 structures called lobules. Within the lobules, sperm develop in structures called seminiferous tubules. During the seventh month of the developmental period of a male fetus, each testis moves through the abdominal musculature to descend into the scrotal cavity. This is called the \u201cdescent of the testis. \u201d Cryptorchidism is the clinical term used when one or both of the testes fail to descend into the scrotum prior to birth."}

{"prompt":"Question: The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by this?\nOptions:\n A. predictive observation\nB. theoretical observation\nC. actual observation\nD. hypothetical observation","completion":"actual observation\nExplanation: Now consider what observer B sees happen to observer A. Observer B perceives light from the right reaching observer A before light from the left, because she has moved towards that flash lamp, lessening the distance the light must travel and reducing the time it takes to get to her. Light travels at speed c relative to both observers, but observer B remains equidistant between the points where the flashes were emitted, while A gets closer to the emission point on the right. From observer B\u2019s point of view, then, there is a time interval between the arrival of the flashes to observer A. From observer B\u2019s point of view, then, there is a time interval between the arrival of the flashes to observer A. In observer A's frame of reference, the flashes occur at different times. Observer B measures the flashes to arrive simultaneously relative to him but not relative to A. Now consider what observer A sees happening. She sees the light from the right arriving before light from the left. Since both lamps are the same distance from her in her reference frame, from her perspective, the right flash occurred before the left flash. Here a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity is not absolute This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, \u201cGedankenexperiment\u201d). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers."}

{"prompt":"Question: What occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance?\nOptions:\n A. dipole\nB. particle\nC. radioactivity\nD. diffusion","completion":"dipole\nExplanation: A dipole occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance. We have already seen dipoles in the form of polar bonds. For example, each O-H bond in water is an example of a dipole; the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond. A molecular dipole is the geometric sum of all the individual bond dipoles in a molecule. In order for a molecule to have a dipole, it must have at least one polar bond. However, not all molecules with polar bonds have an overall molecular dipole. Sometimes the dipoles within a molecule will effectively cancel each other out, giving a zero net molecular dipole. This is often seen in symmetrical molecules."}

{"prompt":"Question: High explosives create shock waves that exceed the speed of sound, a phenomenon that goes by what term?\nOptions:\n A. supersonic\nB. light speed\nC. ion speed\nD. turbulence","completion":"supersonic\nExplanation: The modern day formulation of gun powder is called black powder. It is still commonly used today. Its formulation is still quite similar to what was used in 9 th century China. Black powder is considered a low explosive. It is a mixture that burns quickly, but the resulting shock wave travels at subsonic speeds. The speed at which it burns is dependent on the accessibility of oxygen atoms to the carbon source. In contrast, high explosives like nitroglycerin detonate instead of burning, creating shock waves that are supersonic (faster than the speed of sound)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the group of single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus that have a single piece of circular dna in the nucleoid area of the cell?\nOptions:\n A. chromosomes\nB. algae\nC. prokaryotes\nD. eukaryotes","completion":"prokaryotes\nExplanation: 22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. They have a single piece of circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of the plasma membrane. Some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili. Bacteria and Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. In archaeal membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids, are linked to glycerol. Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers. The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis. The chemical composition of cell walls varies between species. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan, but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls. Bacteria can be divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on the Gram stain reaction. Gram-positive organisms have a thick cell wall, together with teichoic acids. Gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term describes waves that transfer energy through matter?\nOptions:\n A. mechanical currents\nB. mechanical waves\nC. temperature waves\nD. energy currents","completion":"mechanical waves\nExplanation: Ocean waves are among the most impressive waves in the world. They clearly show that waves transfer energy. In the case of ocean waves, energy is transferred through matter. But some waves, called electromagnetic waves, can transfer energy without traveling through matter. These waves can travel through space. You can read more about electromagnetic waves in the chapter \"Electromagnetic Radiation. \" Waves that transfer energy through matter are the focus of the present chapter. These waves are called mechanical waves."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dew point is the temperature at which what occurs?\nOptions:\n A. combustion\nB. condensation\nC. fermentation\nD. precipitation","completion":"condensation\nExplanation: When air is very humid, it doesn\u2019t have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. That\u2019s why glasses of cold drinks \u201csweat\u201d more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day.

{"prompt":"Question: Why is respiratory acidosis considered to be problematic?\nOptions:\n A. causes acid stomach\nB. excess co2 in blood\nC. excess oxygen in blood\nD. causes suffocation","completion":"excess co2 in blood\nExplanation: Metabolic acidosis is problematic, as lower-than-normal amounts of bicarbonate are present in the blood. The pCO2 would be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would decrease as the body reestablishes the proper ratio of bicarbonate and carbonic acid\/CO2. Respiratory acidosis is problematic, as excess CO2 is present in the blood. Bicarbonate levels would be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, they would increase in an attempt to reestablish the proper ratio of bicarbonate and carbonic acid\/CO2. Alkalosis is characterized by a higher-than-normal pH. Metabolic alkalosis is problematic, as elevated pH and excess bicarbonate are present. The pCO2 would again be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would increase as the body attempts to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid\/CO 2. Respiratory alkalosis is problematic, as CO2 deficiency is present in the bloodstream. The bicarbonate concentration would be normal at first. When renal compensation occurs, however, the bicarbonate concentration in blood decreases as the kidneys attempt to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid\/CO2 by eliminating more bicarbonate to bring the pH into the physiological range."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the earth's two poles called?\nOptions:\n A. southwest and south\nB. east and west\nC. west and south\nD. north and south","completion":"north and south\nExplanation: A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron. You\u2019re probably familiar with common bar magnets, like the one shown in the Figure below . Like all magnets, this bar magnet has north and south magnetic poles . The red end of the magnet is the north pole and the blue end is the south pole. The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest. The poles are called north and south because they always line up with Earth\u2019s north-south axis if the magnet is allowed to move freely. (Earth\u2019s axis is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates. )."}
{"prompt":"Question: The fertilized egg that sexually reproducing organisms begin life as is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. gamete\nB. fetus\nC. zygote\nD. infant","completion":"zygote\nExplanation: Introduction The individual sexually reproducing organism\u2014including humans\u2014begins life as a fertilized egg, or zygote. Trillions of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. In other words, that original single cell was the ancestor of every other cell in the body. Once a human individual is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. For example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced. All multicellular organisms use cell division for growth, and in most cases, the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. Single-celled organisms use cell division as their method of reproduction."}
{"prompt":"Question: When a metal is oxidized and a nonmetal is reduced in a redox reaction, what is the resulting compound called?\nOptions:\n A. soluble compound\nB. alloy\nC. ionic compound\nD. magnetic compound","completion":"ionic compound\nExplanation: There are many other examples of redox reactions in which two neutral elements combine to make a compound. These often take the form of a metal being oxidized and a nonmetal being reduced, resulting in an ionic compound. Two nonmetallic elements can also undergo a redox reaction of this type, in which the less electronegative element is oxidized and the more electronegative element is reduced."}
{"prompt":"Question: As hydrostatic pressure in the kidneys increases, what happens to the amount of water leaving the capillares?\nOptions:\n A. it decreases\nB. it increases\nC. it evaporates\nD. it stays the same","completion":"it increases\nExplanation: Hydrostatic pressure is especially important in governing the movement of water in the nephrons of the kidneys to ensure proper filtering of the blood to form urine. As hydrostatic pressure in the kidneys increases, the amount of water leaving the capillaries also increases, and more urine filtrate is formed. If hydrostatic pressure in the kidneys drops too low, as can happen in dehydration, the functions of the kidneys will be impaired, and less nitrogenous wastes will be removed from the bloodstream. Extreme dehydration can result in kidney failure. Fluid also moves between compartments along an osmotic gradient. Recall that an osmotic gradient is produced by the difference in concentration of all solutes on either side of a semi-permeable membrane. The magnitude of the osmotic gradient is proportional to the difference in the concentration of solutes on one side of the cell membrane to that on the other side. Water will move by osmosis from the side where its concentration is high (and the concentration of solute is low) to the side of the membrane where its concentration is low (and the concentration of solute is high). In the body, water moves by osmosis from plasma to the IF (and the reverse) and from the IF to the ICF (and the reverse). In the body, water moves constantly into and out of fluid compartments as conditions change in different parts of the body. For example, if you are sweating, you will lose water through your skin. Sweating depletes your tissues of water and increases the solute concentration in those tissues. As this happens, water diffuses from your blood into sweat glands and surrounding skin tissues that have become dehydrated because of the osmotic gradient. Additionally, as water leaves the blood, it is replaced by the water in other tissues throughout your body that are not dehydrated. If this continues, dehydration spreads throughout the body. When a dehydrated person drinks water and rehydrates, the water is redistributed by the same gradient, but in the opposite direction, replenishing water in all of the tissues."}

{"prompt":"Question: A current in a circuit needs a complete what?\nOptions:\n A. cause\nB. path\nC. speed\nD. stream","completion":"path\nExplanation: Electromagnetic waves generally propagate out from a source in all directions, sometimes forming a complex radiation pattern. A linear antenna like this one will not radiate parallel to its length, for example. The wave is shown in one direction from the antenna in Figure 24.7 to illustrate its basic characteristics. Instead of the AC generator, the antenna can also be driven by an AC circuit. In fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. But while a current in a circuit needs a complete path, an antenna has a varying charge distribution forming a standing wave, driven by the AC. The dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves. This is a resonant phenomenon and when we tune radios or TV, we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna."}

{"prompt":"Question: Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up this?\nOptions:\n A. their hairs\nB. their wings\nC. their scales\nD. their external skeleton","completion":"their external skeleton\nExplanation: Each section contains a liquid crystal sample with a different liquid crystalline range. The section whose liquid crystalline range corresponds to the temperature of the body becomes translucent (here shown in green), indicating the temperature. We also see the effect of liquid crystals in nature. Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person\u2019s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles. With only molecular structure as a guide, one cannot precisely predict which of the various liquid crystalline phases a given compound will actually form. One can, however, identify molecules containing the kinds of structural features that tend to result in liquid crystalline behavior, as demonstrated in Example 11."}

{"prompt":"Question: The migration of what familiar coastal landform involves saltation and gravity?\nOptions:\n A. volcanos\nB. lakes\nC. sand dunes\nD. rivers","completion":"sand dunes\nExplanation: Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune. This is done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground. It always moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows. Can you explain why?."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of pollution is generated by power plants and factories that can directly raise the temperature of water?\nOptions:\n A. atmospheric pollution\nB.

{"prompt":"Question: Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms, known as this?\nOptions:\n A. algorithm\nB. phylogeny\nC. cladistic\nD. pathogeny","completion":"phylogeny\nExplanation: 22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms, known as phylogeny. As with the Scientific Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny. Cladistics is a classification system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny, cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram, a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species are matched and analysed."}
{"prompt":"Question: Not surprisingly, what is the function of the most developed part of a bird's brain?\nOptions:\n A. controlling digestion\nB. controlling breeding\nC. controlling thought\nD. controlling flight","completion":"controlling flight\nExplanation: Birds have a large brain relative to the size of their body. Not surprisingly, the part of the brain that controls flight is the most developed part. The large brain size of birds is also reflected by their high level of intelligence and complex behavior. In fact, birds such as crows and ravens may be more intelligent than many mammals. They are smart enough to use objects such as twigs for tools. They also demonstrate planning and cooperation. Most birds have a poor sense of smell, but they make up for it with their excellent sense of sight. Predatory birds have especially good eyesight. Hawks, for example, have vision that is eight times sharper than human vision."}
{"prompt":"Question: Ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean are called what?\nOptions:\n A. lagoon\nB. trenches\nC. break water\nD. coral reefs","completion":"coral reefs\nExplanation: In which of the following regions would you expect to find photosynthetic organisms? a. The aphotic zone, the neritic zone, the oceanic zone, and the benthic realm. The photic zone, the intertidal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone. The photic zone, the abyssal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone. The pelagic realm, the aphotic zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone. Coral Reefs Coral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean. They are found within 30\u02da north and south of the equator. The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef system located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reefs are fringing islands, which are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reefs surrounding a former island that is now underwater. The coral-forming colonies of organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, thus forming the underwater reef (Figure 20.29). Corals found in shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular protists. The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in which these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow because there are few planktonic organisms for them to feed on. Some corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with protists; these corals must obtain their energy exclusively by feeding on plankton using stinging cells on their tentacles."}
{"prompt":"Question: How do plants support themselves above the ground to get light and oxygen?\nOptions:\n A. momentum\nB. flaccid stems\nC. symbiosis\nD. stiff stems","completion":"stiff stems\nExplanation: Heat and light are forms of energy. Other forms are chemical and electrical energy. Energy can\u2019t be created or destroyed. It can change form. For example, a piece of wood has chemical energy stored in its molecules. When the wood burns, the chemical energy changes to heat and light energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: What tool do scientist's use to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms?\nOptions:\n A. conceptual tree\nB. superficial tree\nC. phylogenetic tree\nD. photogenetic tree","completion":"phylogenetic tree\nExplanation: Phylogenetic Trees Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a \u201ctree of life\u201d can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (Figure 20.2). Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains\u2014 Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya\u2014diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don\u2019t show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species."}

{"prompt":"Question: Who first proposed that earth is a magnet?\nOptions:\n A. Albert Einstein\nB. Isaac Newton\nC. Marconi\nD. william gilbert","completion":"william gilbert\nExplanation: The molar mass of any substance is the mass in grams of one mole of representative particles of that substance. The representative particles can be atoms, molecules, or formula units of ionic compounds. This relationship is frequently used in the laboratory. Suppose that for a certain experiment you need 3.00 moles of calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ). Since calcium chloride is a solid, it would be convenient to use a balance to measure the mass that is needed. The molar mass of CaCl 2 is 110.98 g\/mol. The conversion factor that can be used is then based on the equality that 1 mol = 110.98 g CaCl 2 . Dimensional analysis will allow you to calculate the mass of CaCl 2 that you should measure."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are substances that provide hydrogen ions (h+) and lower ph?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. nutrients\nC. bases\nD. acids","completion":"acids\nExplanation: Acids are substances that provide hydrogen ions (H+) and lower pH, whereas bases provide hydroxide ions (OH\u2013) and raise pH. The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid and lemon juice are very acidic and readily give up H+ when added to water. Conversely, bases are those substances that readily donate OH\u2013. The OH\u2013 ions combine with H+ to produce water, which raises a substance\u2019s pH. Sodium hydroxide and many household cleaners are very alkaline and give up OH\u2013 rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH. Most cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only from 7.2 to 7.6. If the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do other organs in the body. Cells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside of the pH range can induce coma or even cause death. So how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key. Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH\u2013, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforementioned narrow range. Carbon dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the human body; it keeps the pH within the proper range. This buffer system involves carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) anion. If too much H+ enters the body, bicarbonate will combine with the H+ to create carbonic acid and limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH\u2013 is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly dissociate into bicarbonate and H+ ions. The H+ ions can combine with the OH\u2013 ions, limiting the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction, its presence is fleeting because the carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we breathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our bodies would fluctuate too much and we would fail to survive."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do you call accumulation of excess water in the tissues?\nOptions:\n A. gout\nB. asthma\nC. edema\nD. diuretic","completion":"edema\nExplanation: Fluid Balance: Edema Edema is the accumulation of excess water in the tissues. It is most common in the soft tissues of the extremities. The physiological causes of edema include water leakage from blood capillaries. Edema is almost always caused by an underlying medical condition, by the use of certain therapeutic drugs, by pregnancy, by localized injury, or by an allergic reaction. In the limbs, the symptoms of edema include swelling of the subcutaneous tissues, an increase in the normal size of the limb, and stretched, tight skin. One quick way to check for subcutaneous edema localized in a limb is to press a finger into the suspected area. Edema is likely if the depression persists for several seconds after the finger is removed (which is called \u201cpitting\u201d). Pulmonary edema is excess fluid in the air sacs of the lungs, a common symptom of heart and\/or kidney failure. People with pulmonary edema likely will experience difficulty breathing, and they may experience chest pain. Pulmonary edema can be life threatening, because it compromises gas exchange in the lungs, and anyone having symptoms should immediately seek medical care. In pulmonary edema resulting from heart failure, excessive leakage of water occurs because fluids get \u201cbacked up\u201d in the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs, when the left ventricle of the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood into the systemic circulation. Because the left side of the heart is unable to pump out its normal volume of blood, the blood in the pulmonary circulation gets \u201cbacked up,\u201d starting with the left atrium, then into the pulmonary veins, and then into pulmonary capillaries. The resulting increased hydrostatic pressure within pulmonary capillaries, as blood is still coming in from the pulmonary arteries, causes fluid to be pushed out of them and into lung tissues. Other causes of edema include damage to blood vessels and\/or lymphatic vessels, or a decrease in osmotic pressure in chronic and severe liver disease, where the liver is unable to manufacture plasma proteins (Figure 26.9). A decrease in the normal levels of plasma proteins results in a decrease of colloid osmotic pressure (which counterbalances the hydrostatic pressure) in the capillaries. This process causes loss of water from the blood to the surrounding tissues, resulting in edema."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the only way of transferring energy that doesn't require matter?\nOptions:\n A. mutation\nB. evaporation\nC. radiation\nD. convection","completion":"radiation\nExplanation: Both conduction and convection transfer energy through matter. Radiation is the only way of transferring energy that doesn\u2019t require matter. Radiation is the transfer of energy by waves that can travel through empty space. When the waves reach objects, they transfer energy to the objects, causing them to warm up. This is how the sun\u2019s energy reaches Earth and heats its surface (see Figure below ). Radiation is also how thermal energy from a campfire warms people nearby. You might be surprised to learn that all objects radiate thermal energy, including people. In fact, when a room is full of people, it may feel noticeably warmer because of all the thermal energy the people radiate!

{"prompt":"Question: What are the three ways to control the transcription of an operon?\nOptions:\n A. hormonal, repressive, activator,\nB. repressive, activator, spontaneous\nC. transparent , activator , inducible\nD. repressive, activator, inducible","completion":"repressive, activator, inducible\nExplanation: 16.2 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example\u2014the lac operon\u2014two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the lac operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription."}

Ionic\nB. deformation\nC. corrosion\nD. covalent","completion":"covalent\nExplanation: The electron loss and gain is easy to see in a reaction in which ions are formed. However, in many reactions, no such electron transfer occurs. In a molecular compound, electrons are shared between atoms in a type of bond called a covalent bond. Yet it is still common for reactions involving molecular compounds to still be classified as redox reactions."}
{"prompt":"Question: The strength of an acid depends on how many of which ions it produces when it dissolves in water?\nOptions:\n A. silicon\nB. carbon\nC. helium\nD. hydrogen","completion":"hydrogen\nExplanation: The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), which is found in car batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand, acetic acid (CH 3 CO 2 H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the type of combustion engine that you would find in a car?\nOptions:\n A. internal combustion engine\nB. internal oxide engine\nC. internal vapor engine\nD. internal modern engine","completion":"internal combustion engine\nExplanation: A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work.

(Another type of combustion engine is an external combustion engine. )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the climate of a small area called?\nOptions:\n A. ecosystem\nB. microclimate\nC. biome\nD. microevolution","completion":"microclimate\nExplanation: Climate conditions in a small area may be different from those of the surroundings. The climate of the small area is called a microclimate . The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks. The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it. This is because rock and soil gain and lose heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope. Each side supports different amounts and types of vegetation."}
{"prompt":"Question: What proteins synthesized in cells act as catalysts?\nOptions:\n A. hormones\nB. virophages\nC. enzymes\nD. byproducts","completion":"enzymes\nExplanation: Chemical reactions constantly occur inside the cells of living things. However, under the conditions inside cells, most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to maintain life. That\u2019s where enzymes come in. Enzymes are catalysts in living things. Like other catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes are proteins that are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cells\u2019 DNA."}
{"prompt":"Question: Amino acids broken down by metabolic process are mostly recycled into new what?\nOptions:\n A. lipids\nB. hormones\nC. enzymes\nD. proteins","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism Proteins are broken down by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, amino acids are recycled into new proteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of famine, some amino acids will be shunted into pathways of glucose catabolism. Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine."}
{"prompt":"Question: The reaction of calcium oxide with carbon dioxide forms what?\nOptions:\n A. nitrogen carbonate\nB. carbon monoxide\nC. calcium carbonate\nD. nitrogen","completion":"calcium carbonate\nExplanation: The way in which a reaction is written influences the value of the enthalpy change for the reaction. Many reactions are reversible, meaning that the product(s) of the reaction are capable of combining and reforming the reactant(s). If a reaction is written in the reverse direction, the sign of the changes. For example, we can write an equation for the reaction of calcium oxide with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate."}
{"prompt":"Question: In eukaryotic cells, what divides before the cell itself divides?\nOptions:\n A. electrons\nB. cell wall\nC. nucleus\nD. protons","completion":"nucleus\nExplanation: In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus divides before the cell itself divides. The process in which the nucleus divides is called mitosis. Before mitosis occurs, a cell\u2019s DNA is replicated. This is necessary so that each daughter cell will have a complete copy of the genetic material from the parent cell. How is the replicated DNA sorted and separated so that each daughter cell gets a complete set of the genetic material? To understand how this happens, you need to know more about chromosomes."}
{"prompt":"Question: In mammals, four specialized types of what serve to cut, tear, and grind food?\nOptions:\n A. scales\nB. plates\nC. teeth\nD. spines","completion":"teeth\nExplanation: Mammalian teeth are also important for digestion.

This makes food easier and quicker to digest."}
{"prompt":"Question: A hot-water heating system uses what type of energy to heat water?\nOptions:\n A. negative energy\nB. thermal energy\nC. potential energy\nD. atmospheric energy","completion":"thermal energy\nExplanation: A hot-water heating system uses thermal energy to heat water and then pumps the hot water throughout the building in a system of pipes and radiators. You can see a diagram of this type of heating system in Figure below . Typically, the water is heated in a boiler that burns natural gas or heating oil. There is usually a radiator in each room that gets warm when the hot water flows through it. The radiator transfers thermal energy to the air around it by conduction and radiation. The warm air then circulates throughout the room in convection currents. The hot water cools as it flows through the system and transfers its thermal energy. When it finally returns to the boiler, it is heated again and the cycle repeats."}

{"prompt":"Question: What important aspect of the scientific method is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested?\nOptions:\n A. scientific control\nB. hypothesis\nC. string theory\nD. independent variable","completion":"hypothesis\nExplanation: The Process of Science Biology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines? Science (from the Latin scientia, meaning \u201cknowledge\u201d) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method. It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science. The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it."}
{"prompt":"Question: All chemical changes involve a transfer of what?\nOptions:\n A. heating\nB. fuel\nC. energy\nD. Water","completion":"energy\nExplanation: All chemical changes involve a transfer of energy. When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the test tube becomes very warm as energy is released during the reaction. Some other reactions absorb energy. While energy changes are a potential sign of a chemical reaction, care must be taken to ensure that a chemical reaction is indeed taking place. Physical changes may also involve a transfer of energy. A solid absorbs energy when it melts, and the condensation of a gas releases energy. The only way to be certain that a chemical reaction has occurred is to test the composition of the substances after the change has taken place to see if they are different from the starting substances."}

{"prompt":"Question: In a liquid, the particles are still in close contact, so liquids have a definite what?\nOptions:\n A. volume\nB. growth\nC. shape\nD. weight","completion":"volume\nExplanation: Liquids If the particles of a substance have enough energy to partially overcome intermolecular interactions, then the particles can move about each other while remaining in contact. This describes the liquid state. In a liquid, the particles are still in close contact, so liquids have a definite volume. However, because the particles can move about each other rather freely, a liquid has no definite shape and takes a shape dictated by its container."}
{"prompt":"Question: What describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell?\nOptions:\n A. autolysis\nB. exocytosis\nC. endocytosis\nD. expulsion","completion":"exocytosis\nExplanation: Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure below . Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved to the plasma membrane by exocytosis."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of organism has spores that are spread by water and wind?\nOptions:\n A. Plants\nB. Trees\nC. fungi\nD. yeast","completion":"fungi\nExplanation: Spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Some fungi even have \u201ccannons\u201d that \u201cshoot\u201d the spores far from the parent organism. This helps to ensure that the offspring will not have to compete with the parents for space or other resources. You are probably familiar with puffballs, like the one in Figure below . They release a cloud of spores when knocked or stepped on. Wherever the spores happen to land, they do not germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. Then they develop into new hyphae."}

{"prompt":"Question: Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells - they do not affect fungi, which are not prokaryotic, but instead what?\nOptions:\n A. chloroplasts\nB. mammals\nC. plants\nD. eukaryotic","completion":"eukaryotic\nExplanation: Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens Fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues. Humans and other animals can be poisoned by eating toxic mushrooms or foods contaminated by fungi. In addition, individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas compounds that kill fungi also adversely affect the eukaryotic animal host. Many fungal infections ( mycoses) are superficial and termed cutaneous (meaning \u201cskin\u201d) mycoses. They are usually visible on the skin of the animal. Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (Figure 13.26). These fungi are often misnamed \u201cdermatophytes\u201d from the Greek dermis skin and phyte plant, but they are not plants. Dermatophytes are also called \u201cringworms\u201d because of the red ring that they cause on skin (although the ring is caused by fungi, not a worm). These fungi secrete extracellular enzymes that break down keratin (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing a number of conditions such as athlete\u2019s foot, jock itch, and other cutaneous fungal infections. These conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared. More persistent, superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the change of state from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid state?\nOptions:\n A. sublimation\nB. speciation\nC. neutralization\nD. vaporization","completion":"sublimation\nExplanation: Sublimation is the change of state from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid state."}
{"prompt":"Question: Competition within a species is called what?\nOptions:\n A. reproducible competition\nB. species competion\nC. intraspecific competition\nD. internal competition","completion":"intraspecific competition\nExplanation: Competition within a species is called intraspecific competition.

{"prompt":"Question: What \"kind\" of water may take longer to become contaminated than surface water, while the natural cleaning process may take longer?\nOptions:\n A. lake water\nB. spring water\nC. dam water\nD. groundwater","completion":"groundwater\nExplanation: Water pollution happens when contaminants enter water bodies. Contaminants are any substances that harm the health of the environment or humans. Most contaminants enter the water because of humans. Surface water (river or lake) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain, storm water runoff, pesticide runoff, and industrial waste. This water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight, aeration, and microorganisms in the water. Groundwater (private wells and some public water supplies) generally takes longer to become contaminated, but the natural cleaning process also may take much longer. Groundwater can be contaminated by disease-producing pathogens, careless disposal of hazardous household chemical-containing products, agricultural chemicals, and leaking underground storage tanks."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the lightless part of the ocean?\nOptions:\n A. Davy Jones' Locker\nB. photic zone\nC. photoreactive zone\nD. aphotic zone","completion":"aphotic zone\nExplanation: The small surface zone that has light is the photic zone.

{"prompt":"Question: How many pairs of chromosomes are found in human cells?\nOptions:\n A. 25\nB. 24\nC. 23\nD. 13","completion":"23\nExplanation: Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromosome . For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome from your mother. Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs."}
{"prompt":"Question: The role that a particular species plays in its ecosystem is also known as what?\nOptions:\n A. market\nB. type\nC. unique\nD. niche","completion":"niche\nExplanation: Niche is the role that a particular species plays in its ecosystem.

This is called mass movement. The most destructive types of mass movement are landslides and mudslides. They occur suddenly and without warming. They engulf everything in their path."}
{"prompt":"Question: What passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic symphysis?\nOptions:\n A. rectum\nB. vagina\nC. urethra\nD. cerebellum","completion":"urethra\nExplanation: Male Urethra The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic symphysis (see Figure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between men but averages 20 cm in length. It is divided into four regions: the preprostatic urethra, the prostatic urethra, the membranous urethra, and the spongy or penile urethra. The preprostatic urethra is very short and incorporated into the bladder wall. The prostatic urethra passes through the prostate gland. During sexual intercourse, it receives sperm via the ejaculatory ducts and secretions from the seminal vesicles. Paired Cowper\u2019s glands (bulbourethral glands) produce and secrete mucus into the urethra to buffer urethral pH during sexual stimulation. The mucus neutralizes the usually acidic environment and lubricates the urethra, decreasing the resistance to ejaculation. The membranous urethra passes through the deep muscles of the perineum, where it is invested by the overlying urethral sphincters. The spongy urethra exits at the tip (external urethral orifice) of the penis after passing through the corpus spongiosum. Mucous glands are found along much of the length of the urethra and protect the urethra from extremes of urine pH. Innervation is the same in both males and females."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the process by which some solids transition directly into gases?\nOptions:\n A. articulation\nB. vaporization\nC. sublimation\nD. amplification","completion":"sublimation\nExplanation: Sublimation and Deposition Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state, via a process known as sublimation. At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting point of water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high altitudes. When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms (Figure 10.27). The reverse of sublimation is called deposition, a process in which gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition."}
{"prompt":"Question: A very small artery that leads to a capillary is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. arteriole\nB. capillary junction\nC. vein\nD. arterium","completion":"arteriole\nExplanation: Arterioles An arteriole is a very small artery that leads to a capillary. Arterioles have the same three tunics as the larger vessels, but the thickness of each is greatly diminished. The critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact. The tunica media is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in thickness. The tunica externa remains but is very thin (see Figure 20.4). With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing down\u2014or resisting\u2014blood flow and, thus, causing a substantial drop in blood pressure. Because of this, you may see them referred to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a consistent muscle tone\u2014in this case referred to as vascular tone\u2014in a similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal muscle. In reality, all blood vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of smooth muscle. The importance of the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure. The precise diameter of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of blood flow."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the most important source of energy on earth?\nOptions:\n A. the earth's core\nB. water\nC. moon\nD. sun","completion":"sun\nExplanation: The sunlight that reaches Earth is the planet\u2019s most important source of energy. The energy in sunlight, called solar energy, is electromagnetic energy. This is a form of energy that travels through space in electric and magnetic waves. Solar energy can be used to heat homes and produce electricity in solar cells like those on the roof seen in the Figure below . Sunny areas receive plenty of sunlight to generate electricity, but solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy."}
{"prompt":"Question: The ileocecal valve, a sphincter, is usually in a constricted state, but when motility in the ileum increases, this sphincter relaxes, allowing food residue to enter the first portion of what?\nOptions:\n A. small intestine\nB. colon\nC. large intestine\nD. liver","completion":"large intestine\nExplanation: The ileocecal valve, a sphincter, is usually in a constricted state, but when motility in the ileum increases, this sphincter relaxes, allowing food residue to enter the first portion of the large intestine, the cecum. Relaxation of the ileocecal sphincter is controlled by both nerves and hormones. First, digestive activity in the stomach provokes the gastroileal reflex, which increases the force of ileal segmentation. Second, the stomach releases the hormone gastrin, which enhances ileal motility, thus relaxing the ileocecal sphincter. After chyme passes through, backward pressure helps close the sphincter, preventing backflow into the ileum. Because of this reflex, your lunch is completely emptied from your stomach and small intestine by the time you eat your dinner. It takes about 3 to 5 hours for all chyme to leave the small intestine."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you call the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei?\nOptions:\n A. nuclear fission\nB. critical fission\nC. nuclear fusion\nD. cell division","completion":"nuclear fission\nExplanation: Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. For example, nuclear fission of a tiny pellet of uranium-235, like the one pictured in Figure below , can release as much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal!."}
{"prompt":"Question: As a battery is depleted what happens to its internal resistance?\nOptions:\n A. stagnates\nB. changes\nC. reduces\nD. increases","completion":"increases\nExplanation: The internal resistance r can behave in complex ways. As noted, r increases as a battery is depleted. But internal resistance may also depend on the magnitude and direction of the current through a voltage source, its temperature, and even its history. The internal resistance of rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells, for example, depends on how many times and how deeply they have been depleted."}
{"prompt":"Question: Common disease of what system include  asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema?\nOptions:\n A. the fecal system\nB. the digestive system\nC. the respiratory system\nD. the glandular system","completion":"the respiratory system\nExplanation: Common diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema. All of them are diseases of the lungs. The main way to keep your respiratory system healthy is to avoid smoking or breathing in the smoke of others."}
{"prompt":"Question: A mold is an imprint of an organism left in what?\nOptions:\n A. magma\nB. band\nC. fossil\nD. rock","completion":"rock\nExplanation: Fossils may form in other ways. With complete preservation, the organism doesn't change much. As seen below, tree sap may cover an organism and then turn into amber. The original organism is preserved so that scientists might be able to study its DNA. Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice. Molds and casts are another way organisms can be fossilized. A mold is an imprint of an organism left in rock. The organism's remains break down completely. Rock that fills in the mold resembles the original remains. The fossil that forms in the mold is called a cast. Molds and casts usually form in sedimentary rock. With compression, an organism's remains are put under great pressure inside rock layers. This leaves behind a dark stain in the rock."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where do you find the greatest biodiversity?\nOptions:\n A. in shallow lakes\nB. in the tundra\nC. at the poles\nD. in the tropics","completion":"in the tropics\nExplanation: It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus temperate regions, which were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last ice age. The greater age provides more time for speciation. Another possible explanation is the greater energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the lesser energy input in temperate and polar regions. But scientists have not been able to explain how greater energy input could translate into more species. The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the habitat heterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation. However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularity\u2014ecosystems with more species encourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with? The tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. The tropics have their own forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might promote speciation. Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that biodiversity is greatest in the tropics. The number of endemic species is higher in the tropics. The tropics also contain more biodiversity hotspots. At the same time, our knowledge of the species living in the tropics is lowest and because of recent, heavy human activity the potential for biodiversity loss is greatest."}
{"prompt":"Question: During which phase do sister chromatids separate and the centromeres divide?\nOptions:\n A. cell phase\nB. gap cycle\nC. anaphase\nD. passivation","completion":"anaphase\nExplanation: During anaphase , sister chromatids separate and the centromeres divide. The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the spindle fibers. This is like reeling in a fish by shortening the fishing line. One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole. At the end of anaphase, each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes."}

{"prompt":"Question: Methane, ethane, and propane are three of the smallest what?\nOptions:\n A. organisms\nB. atoms\nC. alkanes\nD. microorganisms","completion":"alkanes\nExplanation: The three smallest alkanes are methane, ethane, and propane. Some hydrocarbons have one or more carbon\u2013carbon double bonds (denoted C=C). These hydrocarbons are called alkenes. http:\/\/catalog. flatworldknowledge. com\/bookhub\/reader\/2547 - gobch04_s06_f02shows the formulas and the molecular models of the two simplest alkenes.

{"prompt":"Question: What occurs when two nonpolar liquids are mixed?\nOptions:\n A. sediment - nonpolar interactions\nB. refracted - nonpolar interactions\nC. nonpolar-nonpolar interactions\nD. polar-nonpolar interactions","completion":"nonpolar-nonpolar interactions\nExplanation: Nonpolar-nonpolar interactions occur when two nonpolar liquids are mixed. An example of this is the interaction between toluene and octane (see Figures above and below ). The interactions between a molecule of toluene and a molecule of octane are relatively weak, but so are the toluene-toluene and octane-octane interactions. Because no strong intermolecular forces (like those between water molecules) need to be broken for mixing to occur, no strong interactions need to be formed in order for mixing to be a favorable process. Toluene and octane will form a homogeneous mixture. The phrase \"like dissolves like\" applies to these mixtures as well. In this case, nonpolar dissolves nonpolar."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dna segments cross over to form what kind of chromosome?\nOptions:\n A. mutated\nB. resistant\nC. autosome\nD. recombinant","completion":"recombinant\nExplanation: Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover\u2014or genetic recombination\u2014between the non-sister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded DNA is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome. There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible. The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to create recombinant chromosomes."}
{"prompt":"Question: Drinking too much water too fast can lead to what potentially fatal condition, which causes dangerous changes to salt levels?\nOptions:\n A. inebriation\nB. osmosis\nC. drowning\nD. water intoxication","completion":"water intoxication\nExplanation: available; if arsenic is an essential trace mineral in human diets, it is probably required on the order of 50 ppb or less. A toxic dose of arsenic corresponds to about 7,000 ppb and higher, which is over 140 times the trace amount that may be required by the body. Thus, arsenic is not poisonous in and of itself. Rather, it is the amount that is dangerous: the dose makes the poison. Similarly, as much as water is needed to keep us alive, too much of it is also risky to our health. Drinking too much water too fast can lead to a condition called water intoxication, which may be fatal. The danger in water intoxication is not that water itself becomes toxic. It is that the ingestion of too much water too fast dilutes sodium ions, potassium ions, and other salts in the bloodstream to concentrations that are not high enough to support brain, muscle, and heart functions. Military personnel, endurance athletes, and even desert hikers are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink water but do not replenish the salts lost in sweat. As this example shows, even the right substances in the wrong amounts can be dangerous!."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and the body?\nOptions:\n A. stem\nB. silt\nC. node\nD. mantle","completion":"mantle\nExplanation: Two unique features of mollusks are the mantle and radula (see Figure above ). The mantle is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and the body. It secretes calcium carbonate to form the shell. It forms a cavity, called the mantle cavity, between the mantle and the body. The mantle cavity pumps water for filter feeding. The radula is a feeding organ with teeth made of chitin. It is located in front of the mouth in the head region. Herbivorous mollusks use the radula to scrape food such as algae off rocks. Predatory mollusks use the radula to drill holes in the shells of their prey."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the salts of fatty acids called?\nOptions:\n A. dyes\nB. soaps\nC. creams\nD. malts","completion":"soaps\nExplanation: Soaps and Detergents Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35\u2014 unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the \u2014 CO 2 \u2212 unit (Figure 11.32)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Recognition of pathogens is a function of what type of response?\nOptions:\n A. digestion\nB. immune\nC. inhalation\nD. hormones","completion":"immune\nExplanation: Recognition of Pathogens Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogenspecific molecules, such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins, using pattern recognition receptors. A pattern recognition receptor (PRR) is a membrane-bound receptor that recognizes characteristic features of a pathogen and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells. These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell surface whether they are needed or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the fact that each receptor type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited by the finite surface area of the cell membrane. Thus, the innate immune system must \u201cget by\u201d using only a limited number of receptors that are active against as wide a variety of pathogens as possible. This strategy is in stark contrast to the approach used by the adaptive immune system, which uses large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to a particular pathogen. Should the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a species of pathogen they recognize, the cell will bind to the pathogen and initiate phagocytosis (or cellular apoptosis in the case of an intracellular pathogen) in an effort to destroy the offending microbe. Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include receptors for bacterial components and for complement, discussed below."}

At birth, the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified nor are the sutures of the skull closed. This allows the skull and shoulders to deform during passage through the birth canal. The last bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term refers to the friction of fluid, within itself and its surroundings?\nOptions:\n A. elasticity\nB. volume\nC. viscosity\nD. salinity","completion":"viscosity\nExplanation: 12.4 Viscosity and Laminar Flow; Poiseuille\u2019s Law Laminar Flow and Viscosity When you pour yourself a glass of juice, the liquid flows freely and quickly. But when you pour syrup on your pancakes, that liquid flows slowly and sticks to the pitcher. The difference is fluid friction, both within the fluid itself and between the fluid and its surroundings. We call this property of fluids viscosity. Juice has low viscosity, whereas syrup has high viscosity. In the previous sections we have considered ideal fluids with little or no viscosity. In this section, we will investigate what factors, including viscosity, affect the rate of fluid flow. The precise definition of viscosity is based on laminar, or nonturbulent, flow. Before we can define viscosity, then, we need to define laminar flow and turbulent flow. Figure 12.10 shows both types of flow. Laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix. Turbulent flow, or turbulence, is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the ratio of solutes in a solution to a volume of solvent in a solution known as?\nOptions:\n A. equilibrium\nB. molarity\nC. osmolality\nD. molality","completion":"osmolality\nExplanation: Regulation of Water Intake Osmolality is the ratio of solutes in a solution to a volume of solvent in a solution. Plasma osmolality is thus the ratio of solutes to water in blood plasma. A person\u2019s plasma osmolality value reflects his or her state of hydration. A healthy body maintains plasma osmolality within a narrow range, by employing several mechanisms that regulate both water intake and output. Drinking water is considered voluntary. So how is water intake regulated by the body? Consider someone who is experiencing dehydration, a net loss of water that results in insufficient water in blood and other tissues. The water that leaves the body, as exhaled air, sweat, or urine, is ultimately extracted from blood plasma. As the blood becomes more concentrated, the thirst response\u2014a sequence of physiological processes\u2014is triggered (Figure 26.10). Osmoreceptors are sensory receptors in the thirst center in the hypothalamus that monitor the concentration of solutes (osmolality) of the blood. If blood osmolality increases above its ideal value, the hypothalamus transmits signals that result in a conscious awareness of thirst. The person should (and normally does) respond by drinking water. The hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH) through the posterior pituitary gland. ADH signals the kidneys to recover water from urine, effectively diluting the blood plasma. To conserve water, the hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also sends signals via the sympathetic nervous system to the salivary glands in the mouth. The signals result in a decrease in watery, serous output (and an increase in stickier, thicker mucus output). These changes in secretions result in a \u201cdry mouth\u201d and the sensation of thirst."}

{"prompt":"Question: Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of frequency and this?\nOptions:\n A. wavelength\nB. gravity\nC. momentum\nD. energy","completion":"wavelength\nExplanation: Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. You can observe direct evidence of the speed of sound while watching a fireworks display. The flash of an explosion is seen well before its sound is heard, implying both that sound travels at a finite speed and that it is much slower than light. You can also directly sense the frequency of a sound. Perception of frequency is called pitch. The wavelength of sound is not directly sensed, but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the size of musical instruments with their pitch. Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while large instruments, such as a tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds. Similar arguments hold that a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds. The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is an ion that is in common to both salts in a solution?\nOptions:\n A. common ion\nB. regular ion\nC. strong ion\nD. native ion","completion":"common ion\nExplanation: This situation describes the common ion effect. A common ion is an ion that is in common to both salts in a solution. In the above example, the common ion is Ca 2+ . The common ion effect is a decrease in the solubility of an ionic compound as a result of the addition of a common ion. Adding calcium ion to the saturated solution of calcium sulfate causes additional CaSO 4 to precipitate from the solution, lowering its solubility. The addition of a solution containing sulfate ion, such as potassium sulfate, would result in the same common ion effect."}
{"prompt":"Question: When do weather balloons return to earth?\nOptions:\n A. when the air heats up\nB. when the timer runs out\nC. when the air cools\nD. when it bursts","completion":"when it bursts\nExplanation: Weather stations contain many instruments for measuring weather conditions. The weather balloon ( Figure above ) will rise into the atmosphere until it bursts. As it rises, it will gather weather data and send it to the surface. Many weather satellites orbit Earth. They constantly collect and transmit weather data from high above the surface. A radar device sends out radio waves in all directions. The waves bounce off water in the atmosphere and then return to the sender. The radar data shows where precipitation is falling. It\u2019s raining in the orange-shaded area shown above."}

{"prompt":"Question: Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, also called what?\nOptions:\n A. ridges\nB. crevasses\nC. faults\nD. fissures","completion":"fissures\nExplanation: At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock rises, it goes from higher to lower pressure. This is because there is no longer the weight of all the rock above it. Lower pressure lowers the melting temperature of the rock (2 in the previous section). This is why there is volcanism at divergent plate boundaries. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures."}
{"prompt":"Question: Typically done to find food or mates, what do you call the regular movement of individuals or populations each year during certain seasons?\nOptions:\n A. migration\nB. emmigration\nC. erosion\nD. industrialization","completion":"migration\nExplanation: Migration is another type of movement that changes population size. Migration is the regular movement of individuals or populations each year during certain seasons. The purpose of migration usually is to find food, mates, or other resources. For example, many northern hemisphere birds migrate thousands of miles south each fall. They go to areas where the weather is warmer and more resources are available (see Figure below ). Then they return north in the spring to nest. Some animals, such as elk, migrate vertically. They go up the sides of mountains in spring as snow melts. They go back down the mountain sides in fall as snow returns."}

Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals. Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with the decaying process."}
{"prompt":"Question: The number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a what?\nOptions:\n A. xerophyte\nB. spirogyra\nC. karyogram\nD. nanocyte","completion":"karyogram\nExplanation: 13.2 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders The number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities. Disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects. Aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or deleted. Chromosome structures may also be rearranged, for example by inversion or translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in problematic phenotypic effects. Because they force chromosomes to assume unnatural topologies during meiosis, inversions and translocations are often associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction."}

{"prompt":"Question: The study of how organisms develop is known as?\nOptions:\n A. ethology\nB. embryology\nC. botany\nD. physics","completion":"embryology\nExplanation: Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology , the study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for polyatomic ligands with two or more donor atoms?\nOptions:\n A. chelates\nB. proteins\nC. polyamines\nD. angiosperms","completion":"chelates\nExplanation: Transition metals form metal complexes, polyatomic species in which a metal ion is bound to one or more ligands, which are groups bound to a metal ion. Complex ions are electrically charged metal complexes, and a coordination compound contains one or more metal complexes. Metal complexes with low coordination numbers generally have only one or two possible structures, whereas those with coordination numbers greater than six can have several different structures. Coordination numbers of two and three are common for d10 metal ions. Tetrahedral and square planar complexes have a coordination number of four; trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal complexes have a coordination number of five; and octahedral complexes have a coordination number of six. At least three structures are known for a coordination number of seven, which is generally found for only large metal ions. Coordination numbers of eight and nine are also found for larger metal ions. The stability of metal complexes with first-row transition metals in a +2 oxidation state varies inversely with their ionic radius. Lewis bases can be hard bases, which have small, relatively nonpolarizable donor atoms, orsoft bases, with larger, relatively polarizable donor atoms. Hard acids have the highest affinity for hard bases, and soft acids have the highest affinity for soft bases. Soft metals and soft bases form complexes that are more stable than would be predicted based on electrostatic arguments, which suggests that metal-to-ligand \u03c0 bonding is important. Ligands that are strong bases form the most stable complexes with metal ions that are hard acids. Exceptionally stable complexes are formed by chelates, which are polyatomic ligands with two or more donor atoms; this enhanced stability is known as the chelate effect. Many metal complexes formisomers, which are two or more compounds with the same formula but different arrangements of atoms. Structural isomers differ in which atoms are bonded to one another, while geometrical isomers differ only in the arrangement of ligands around the metal ion. Ligands adjacent to one another are cis, while ligands across from one another are trans."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do plants do to prevent water loss at night?\nOptions:\n A. close their stems\nB. shed their petals\nC. close their leaves\nD. open their petals","completion":"close their leaves\nExplanation: Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Environmental stimuli that indicate changing seasons trigger other responses. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant . They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme cold and dryness of winter. Dormancy ensures that seeds will germinate and plants will grow only when conditions are favorable."}

{"prompt":"Question: What part of the plant is the main site of photosynthesis?\nOptions:\n A. leaf\nB. soil\nC. root\nD. stem","completion":"leaf\nExplanation: 30.4 Leaves Leaves are the main site of photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of a lamina (the broad part of the leaf, also called the blade) and a petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to a stem). The arrangement of leaves on a stem, known as phyllotaxy, enables maximum exposure to sunlight. Each plant species has a characteristic leaf arrangement and form. The pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite, or spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. Leaf tissue consists of the epidermis, which forms the outermost cell layer, and mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up the inner portion of the leaf. In some plant species, leaf form is modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud scales, and needles."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of protein speeds up chemical reactions in cells?\nOptions:\n A. hemoglobin\nB. lipids\nC. collagen\nD. enzyme","completion":"enzyme\nExplanation: Proteins are an essential part of all organisms. They play many roles in living things. Certain proteins provide a scaffolding that maintains the shape of cells (structural proteins). Proteins also make up the majority of muscle tissues. Many proteins are enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in cells. Enzymes interact with the substrates (reactants) of a biochemical reaction, helping the reaction proceed at a much faster rate. Other proteins are antibodies that protect you from pathogens. Antibodies bond to foreign substances in the body and target them for destruction. Still other proteins help carry messages or materials in and out of cells (transport proteins) or around the body. For example, the blood protein hemoglobin (see Figure below ) bonds with oxygen and carries it from the lungs to cells throughout the body."}

{"prompt":"Question: Enzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain tend to catalyze reactions that are what?\nOptions:\n A. continuous\nB. reversible\nC. non-reversible\nD. changeable","completion":"non-reversible\nExplanation: Control of Catabolic Pathways Enzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain tend to catalyze non-reversible reactions. In other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed to proceeding with the remaining reactions. Whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs of the cell (as reflected by the levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP). Glycolysis The control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, hexokinase (Figure 7.19). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step. The presence of the negatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell. When hexokinase is inhibited, glucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue. The product of the hexokinase reaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited."}

{"prompt":"Question: Insulin is produced by what part of the body?\nOptions:\n A. kidneys\nB. pancreas\nC. liver\nD. thyroid","completion":"pancreas\nExplanation: 17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha cells, which produce glucagon; beta cells, which produce insulin; delta cells, which produce somatostatin; and PP cells, which produce pancreatic polypeptide. Insulin and glucagon are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin is produced by the beta cells in response to high blood glucose levels. It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, as well as the storage of excess glucose for later use. Dysfunction of the production of insulin or target cell resistance to the effects of insulin causes diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. The hormone glucagon is produced and secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates mechanisms that increase blood glucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into glucose."}

Those neurons project into the cerebellum, providing a copy of motor commands sent to the spinal cord. Sensory information from the periphery, which enters through spinal or cranial nerves, is copied to a nucleus in the medulla known as the inferior olive. Fibers from this nucleus enter the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the cerebrum. If the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe sends a command down to the spinal cord to initiate walking, a copy of that instruction is sent to the cerebellum. Sensory feedback from the muscles and joints, proprioceptive information about the movements of walking, and sensations of balance are sent to the cerebellum through the inferior olive and the cerebellum compares them. If walking is not coordinated, perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is blowing, then the cerebellum sends out a."}

{"prompt":"Question: Calvin cycle reactions can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and this?\nOptions:\n A. regeneration\nB. transformation\nC. creation\nD. demarcation","completion":"regeneration\nExplanation: The Calvin cycle reactions (Figure 5.15) can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. In the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other chemicals are present to initiate the Calvin cycle: an enzyme abbreviated RuBisCO, and the molecule ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). RuBP has five atoms of carbon and a phosphate group on each end. RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP, which forms a six-carbon compound that is immediately converted into two three-carbon compounds. This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is \u201cfixed\u201d from its inorganic form into organic molecules. ATP and NADPH use their stored energy to convert the three-carbon compound, 3-PGA, into another three-carbon compound called G3P. This type of reaction is called a reduction reaction, because it involves the gain of electrons. A reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. The molecules of ADP and NAD+, resulting from the reduction reaction, return to the light-dependent reactions to be re-energized. One of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to contribute to the formation of the carbohydrate molecule, which is commonly glucose (C6H12O6). Because the carbohydrate molecule has six carbon atoms, it takes six turns of the Calvin cycle to make one carbohydrate molecule (one for each carbon dioxide molecule fixed). The remaining G3P molecules regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for the carbon-fixation step. ATP is also used in the regeneration of RuBP."}

{"prompt":"Question: The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon where?\nOptions:\n A. before the oceans\nB. in the earth\nC. in the oceans\nD. after the oceans","completion":"in the oceans\nExplanation: As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide that is essential to the process of photosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each, and each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with calcium ions in the seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of the shells of marine organisms. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth. On land, carbon is stored in soil as organic carbon as a result of the decomposition of living organisms or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals. Deeper under the ground, at land and at sea, are fossil fuels, the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable resource is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents. Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large number of land animals raised to feed Earth\u2019s growing human population results in increased carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere caused by their respiration. This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes, plant growth, soil carbon levels, and respiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase."}
{"prompt":"Question: What part of the plant, in general, is responsible for transport and storage of water and minerals?\nOptions:\n A. leaves\nB. pistil\nC. petals\nD. stems","completion":"stems\nExplanation: Stems are needed for transport and storage. Their vascular tissue carries water and minerals from roots to leaves. It carries dissolved sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above the ground in the air. In many plants, ground tissue in stems also stores food or water during cold or dry seasons."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which type of weathering causes changes int he rocks materials, chemical or mechanical?\nOptions:\n A. liquid\nB. nuclear\nC. chemical\nD. mineral","completion":"chemical\nExplanation: The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil.

{"prompt":"Question: What functional units of chromosomes determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins?\nOptions:\n A. chromosomes\nB. DNA\nC. genes\nD. cells","completion":"genes\nExplanation: Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous (\u201csame knowledge\u201d) chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location, or locus. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or black. Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are not identical. The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB. Minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within a species. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference is less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes are different."}
{"prompt":"Question: In what century was the microscope invented?\nOptions:\n A. 20th\nB. 16th\nC. 15th\nD. 17th","completion":"17th\nExplanation: 7.2 History of cell knowledge The optical microscope was first invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include: \u2022 The invention of the microscope11 , which allowed scientists for the first time to see biological cells \u2022 Robert Hooke12 in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called cork \"cells\" \u2022 Anton van Leeuwenhoek13 called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the microscope \"animalcules\" \u2022 Matthias Jakob Schleiden14 , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of cells \u2022 Theodor Schwann15 , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells \u2022 Rudolf Virchow16 proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations, the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells. In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the first statement of their joint cell theory."}

Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What method plays a role in determining the approximate age of the earth and makes use of uranium?\nOptions:\n A. fuel dating\nB. radioactive dating\nC. carbon dating\nD. waste dating","completion":"radioactive dating\nExplanation: Things Great and Small Nuclear Decay Helps Explain Earth\u2019s Hot Interior A puzzle created by radioactive dating of rocks is resolved by radioactive heating of Earth\u2019s interior. This intriguing story is another example of how small-scale physics can explain large-scale phenomena. Radioactive dating plays a role in determining the approximate age of the Earth. The oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5\u00d710 9 years ago\u2014a number determined by uranium-238 dating. These rocks could only have solidified once the surface of the Earth had cooled sufficiently. The temperature of the Earth at formation can be estimated based on gravitational potential energy of the assemblage of pieces being converted to thermal energy. Using heat transfer concepts discussed in Thermodynamics it is then possible to calculate how long it would take for the surface to cool to rock9 9 formation temperatures. The result is about 10 years. The first rocks formed have been solid for 3.5\u00d710 years, so that 9 the age of the Earth is approximately 4.5\u00d710 years. There is a large body of other types of evidence (both Earth-bound and solar system characteristics are used) that supports this age. The puzzle is that, given its age and initial temperature, the center of the Earth should be much cooler than it is today (see Figure 31.26)."}

They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classified as plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem, and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can differ in size and shape as well. There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae), rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoflagellates), and euglenophytes (euglenoids)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the process in which organisms reproduce sexually by joining gametes called?\nOptions:\n A. fertilization\nB. propagation\nC. migration\nD. stimulation","completion":"fertilization\nExplanation: Organisms that reproduce sexually by joining gametes , a process known as fertilization , must have a mechanism to produce haploid gametes. This mechanism is meiosis , a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes. Meiosis occurs only in gamete producing cells within the gonads. During meiosis the pairs of chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair. Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between, starting with one diploid cell and generating four haploid cells ( Figure below ). Each division, named meiosis I and meiosis II, has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. These stages are similar to those of mitosis, but there are distinct and important differences."}

Food waste leaves the body through the anus."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the movement of substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy called?\nOptions:\n A. inner cell transport\nB. immune transport\nC. passive transport\nD. active transport","completion":"passive transport\nExplanation: membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials\u2014like glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes\u2014need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods, which are categorized based on whether or not energy is required. Passive transport is the movement of substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy. In contrast, active transport is the movement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose what?\nOptions:\n A. mass\nB. protons\nC. neutrons\nD. electrons","completion":"electrons\nExplanation: Electron Configurations of Ions We have seen that ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are the first electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the s orbital are easier to remove than the d or f electrons, and so the highest ns electrons are lost, and then the (n \u2013 1)d or (n \u2013 2)f electrons are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are added to a parent atom. The added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle."}
{"prompt":"Question: Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia have life-threatening levels of cholesterol because their cells cannot clear what particles from their blood?\nOptions:\n A. iron (Fe)\nB. oxygen (O)\nC. low-density lipoprotein (ldl)\nD. high - density lipoprotein (hdl)","completion":"low-density lipoprotein (ldl)\nExplanation: In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood. Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells."}

Pinworms have a fairly simple life cycle with only one host."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the ability to change or move matter?\nOptions:\n A. volume\nB. temperature\nC. energy\nD. density","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All living things need energy. They need energy for everything they do, whether it is to move long distances or simply to carry out basic biochemical processes inside cells. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight. In a few ecosystems, energy enters in the form of chemical compounds. All ecosystems need a constant input of energy in one of these two forms."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where does the process of assembling amino acids into a protein take place?\nOptions:\n A. in the nucleus\nB. in chromosomes\nC. in the chitin\nD. in the ribosome","completion":"in the ribosome\nExplanation: The process of assembling amino acids into a protein takes place in the ribosome. This structure consists of two subunits, each of which is composed of both proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The two subunits clamp together on the mRNA and catalyze the formation of the amide linkages in the growing protein. When protein synthesis is complete, the two subunits dissociate and release the completed protein chain."}
{"prompt":"Question: Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in this?\nOptions:\n A. fertilization\nB. spontaneous mutation\nC. mass extinction\nD. next generation","completion":"next generation\nExplanation: Processes and Patterns of Evolution Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes. Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes caused by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation affects the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitness\u2014lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype; these are called neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each of the offspring. A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation. Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the \u201cfit\u201d of the population to its environment. The webbed feet of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. The snow leopards\u2019 thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. The cheetahs\u2019 fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of weathering is abrasion?\nOptions:\n A. molecular\nB. electromagnetic\nC. natural\nD. mechanical","completion":"mechanical\nExplanation: Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion it moves rocks so that they bump against one another ( Figure below ). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion."}
{"prompt":"Question: During fetal development of the heart, what does the bulbus cordis develop into?\nOptions:\n A. right atrium\nB. last ventricle\nC. left atrium\nD. right ventricle","completion":"right ventricle\nExplanation: Following ventricular repolarization, the ventricles begin to relax, and pressure within the ventricles drops. When the pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the atrioventricular valves and marking one complete heart cycle. 35 Afterload represents the resistance within the arteries to the flow of blood ejected from the ventricles. If uncompensated, if afterload increases, flow will decrease. In order for the heart to maintain adequate flow to overcome increasing afterload, it must pump more forcefully. This is one of the negative consequences of high blood pressure or hypertension. 37 After fusion of the two endocardial tubes into the single primitive heart, five regions quickly become visible. From the head, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus. Contractions propel the blood from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. About day 23, the heart begins to form an S-shaped structure within the pericardium. The bulbus cordis develops into the right ventricle, whereas the primitive ventricle becomes the left ventricle. The interventricular septum separating these begins to form about day 28. The atrioventricular valves form between weeks five to eight. At this point, the heart ventricles resemble the adult structure."}

{"prompt":"Question: When members of the same species compete for the same resources, it is called what?\nOptions:\n A. interspecies competition\nB. intraspecific competition\nC. natural selection\nD. extinction","completion":"intraspecific competition\nExplanation: Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources. For example, two trees may grow close together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are usually genetically different, they have different characteristics, and in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive. The other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which organ in the human body filters blood and excretes urine?\nOptions:\n A. the liver\nB. the kidney\nC. the bladder\nD. the thyroid","completion":"the kidney\nExplanation: The kidneys filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine . The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin , for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. They also secrete renin, which regulates blood pressure, and calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, which helps maintain calcium for bones. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water."}

Prokaryotic cells alter the transcription rate to turn genes on or off. This method will increase or decrease protein levels in response to what is needed by the cell. Eukaryotic cells change the accessibility (epigenetic), transcription, or translation of a gene. This will alter the amount of RNA, and the lifespan of the RNA, to alter the amount of protein that exists. Eukaryotic cells also change the protein\u2019s translation to increase or decrease its overall levels. Eukaryotic organisms are much more complex and can manipulate protein levels by changing many stages in the process."}

{"prompt":"Question: Slime molds have several morphological similarities to fungi, including spore-generation, that are thought to be the result of convergent what?\nOptions:\n A. generation\nB. phenomenon\nC. emergence\nD. evolution","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: Slime Molds A subset of the amoebozoans, the slime molds, has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought to be the result of convergent evolution. For instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies, much like fungi. The slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types. Plasmodial slime molds are composed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage (Figure 23.27). Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along. Upon maturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times of stress. Haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or water to potentially land in more favorable environments. If this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate haploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle."}
{"prompt":"Question: Gap genes are defined by the effect of what in that gene?\nOptions:\n A. mutation\nB. infection\nC. radiation\nD. modification","completion":"mutation\nExplanation: One example of a gap gene is the Kr\u00fcppel gene, which regulates the activity of a number of other genes. Kr\u00fcppel literally means \"cripple\" in German, named for the crippled appearance of mutant larva. Gap genes are defined by the effect of a mutation in that gene, and Kr\u00fcppel is one such effect. Other gap genes are known as tailless and knirps (a \"squirt or whippersnapper\"). Gap genes encode transcription factors which directly effect the expression of additional genes involved in embryo segmentation, called the pair-rule genes . Pair-rule genes are expressed in alternating segments within the developing embryo. Pair-rule genes have very creative names, such as even-skipped, hairy, odd-skipped, odd-paired, sloppy paired and fushi tarazu , which is Japanese for \u201cfew segments. \u201d See My favorite silly gene names at http:\/\/www. itsokaytobesmart. com\/post\/82318778810\/funny-gene-names for a list of other interesting gene names."}

{"prompt":"Question: A synergist that makes the insertion site more stable is called a what?\nOptions:\n A. dominator\nB. lesion\nC. fixator\nD. kilocalorie","completion":"fixator\nExplanation: CHAPTER REVIEW 11.1 Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems Skeletal muscles each have an origin and an insertion. The end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being pulled is called the muscle\u2019s insertion and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed, or stabilized, bone is called the origin. The muscle primarily responsible for a movement is called the prime mover, and muscles that assist in this action are called synergists. A synergist that makes the insertion site more stable is called a fixator. Meanwhile, a muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. Several factors contribute to the force generated by a skeletal muscle. One is the arrangement of the fascicles in the skeletal muscle. Fascicles can be parallel, circular, convergent, pennate, fusiform, or triangular. Each arrangement has its own range of motion and ability to do work."}

{"prompt":"Question: Human skin color is primarily due to the presence of what pigment in the skin?\nOptions:\n A. tannin\nB. melatonin\nC. melanin\nD. cytoplasm","completion":"melanin\nExplanation: Human skin color is primarily due to the presence of the pigment melanin in the skin. Melanin is not a protein, but it is the product of a biosynthetic pathway. Skin color is a polygenic trait and obviously demonstrates quantitative characteristics. A number of genes factor into determining a person's natural skin color, so modifying only one of those genes changes the color only slightly. It is currently thought that at least three separately inherited genes contribute to skin pigmentation. Let\u2019s call these three genes A, B, and C. A, B, and C are incompletely dominant to a, b, and c, with A, B, and C each contributing a \u201cunit of darkness\u201d to the phenotype. Therefore an AABBCC individual is very dark, darker than an AaBbCc individual, and much darker than a aabbcc individual. A person may have as many as 6 \u201cdark units\u201d to as few as no \u201cdark units,\u201d and any combination in between. This will result in a phenotypic spectrum of color gradation. When graphed, a phenotypic spectrum usually results in a bell-shaped curve, with extreme phenotypes on both ends and more common phenotypes in the center of the curve."}
{"prompt":"Question: How many valence electrons do neutral phosphorus atoms have?\nOptions:\n A. nine\nB. three\nC. five\nD. four","completion":"five\nExplanation: The highest-numbered shell is the third shell, which has 2 electrons in the 3s subshell and 3 electrons in the 3p subshell.

It tends to collect in the basements of houses and poses a significant health risk if present in indoor air. Many states now require that houses be tested for radon before they are sold. Calculate the density of radon at 1.00 atm pressure and 20\u00b0C and compare it with the density of nitrogen gas, which constitutes 80% of the atmosphere, under the same conditions to see why radon is found in basements rather than in attics. Answer: radon, 9.23 g\/L; N2, 1.17 g\/L A common use of Equation 10.23 is to determine the molar mass of an unknown gas by measuring its density at a known temperature and pressure. This method is particularly useful in identifying a gas that has been produced in a reaction, and it is not difficult to carry out. A flask or glass bulb of known volume is carefully dried, evacuated, sealed, and weighed empty. It is then filled with a sample of a gas at a known temperature and pressure and reweighed. The difference in mass between the two readings is the mass of the gas. The volume of the flask is usually determined by weighing the flask when empty and when filled with a liquid of known density such as water. The use of density measurements to calculate molar masses is illustrated in Example 10."}

{"prompt":"Question: Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via what?\nOptions:\n A. fermentation\nB. condensation\nC. combustion\nD. liquidation","completion":"condensation\nExplanation: pressure above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as a linear relationship using the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation. This equation can be used to calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of a liquid from its measured vapor pressure at two or more temperatures. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. The temperature at which a substance boils at a pressure of 1 atm is its normal boiling point."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity?\nOptions:\n A. evacuation\nB. ramping\nC. vaccination\nD. priming","completion":"vaccination\nExplanation: Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares \"memory\" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick."}

{"prompt":"Question: Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of what pass?\nOptions:\n A. layers cord\nB. Brain Cord\nC. steering cord\nD. spinal cord","completion":"spinal cord\nExplanation: Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on each side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral column is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of the body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a spring (Figure 38.8). Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The inner part of discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb shocks. The Thoracic Cage The thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages (Figure 38.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing. The sternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult. The ribs are 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body, forming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12, which are free-floating ribs."}

{"prompt":"Question: Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in what?\nOptions:\n A. chemical bonds\nB. molecular bonds\nC. liquid bonds\nD. crystals bonds","completion":"chemical bonds\nExplanation: Catabolic Reactions Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in the chemical bonds. These energy releases (conversions) are not 100 percent efficient. The amount of energy released is less than the total amount contained in the molecule. Approximately 40 percent of energy yielded from catabolic reactions is directly transferred to the high-energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP, the energy currency of cells, can be used immediately to power molecular machines that support cell, tissue, and organ function. This includes building new tissue and repairing damaged tissue. ATP can also be stored to fulfill future energy demands. The remaining 60 percent of the energy released from catabolic reactions is given off as heat, which tissues and body fluids absorb. Structurally, ATP molecules consist of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups (Figure 24.2). The chemical bond between the second and third phosphate groups, termed a high-energy bond, represents the greatest source of energy in a cell. It is the first bond that catabolic enzymes break when cells require energy to do work. The products of this reaction are a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a lone phosphate group (Pi). ATP, ADP, and Pi are constantly being cycled through reactions that build ATP and store energy, and reactions that break down ATP and release energy."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in ________ with other elements?\nOptions:\n A. isolation\nB. cooperation\nC. combination\nD. competition","completion":"combination\nExplanation: Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr) is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very \u201ceager\u201d to gain an electron. At the URL below, you can watch a video that shows just how reactive the alkali metals are."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the seeds used for large-scale agricultural production?\nOptions:\n A. old-fashioned seeds\nB. modified seeds\nC. heirloom seeds\nD. original seeds","completion":"heirloom seeds\nExplanation: larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent flooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants. Other threats to tropical forests come from poachers, who log trees for their precious wood. Ebony and Brazilian rosewood, both on the endangered list, are examples of tree species driven almost to extinction by indiscriminate logging. The number of plant species becoming extinct is increasing at an alarming rate. Because ecosystems are in a delicate balance, and seed plants maintain close symbiotic relationships with animals\u2014whether predators or pollinators\u2014the disappearance of a single plant can lead to the extinction of connected animal species. A real and pressing issue is that many plant species have not yet been catalogued, and so their place in the ecosystem is unknown. These unknown species are threatened by logging, habitat destruction, and loss of pollinators. They may become extinct before we have the chance to begin to understand the possible impacts from their disappearance. Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action, from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species. Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the seeds used for large-scale agricultural production. Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences, taken from a well-characterized portion of the genome, are used to identify a species through DNA analysis."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms called?\nOptions:\n A. skulls\nB. fossils\nC. rocks\nD. basalt","completion":"fossils\nExplanation: Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms from the distant past. Examples of fossils include bones, teeth, and impressions. By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is revealed. Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils to learn about life in the past. Fossils allow these scientists to determine the features of extinct species. Paleontologists compare the features of species from different periods in history. With this information, they try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years ( Figure below )."}

{"prompt":"Question: The general term peptide refers to an amino acid chain of what?\nOptions:\n A. large length\nB. incomplete length\nC. small length\nD. unspecified length","completion":"unspecified length\nExplanation: The general term peptide refers to an amino acid chain of unspecified length. However, chains of about 50 amino acids or more are usually called proteins or polypeptides. In its physiologically active form, a protein may be composed of one or more polypeptide chains. For peptides and proteins to be physiologically active, it is not enough that they incorporate certain amounts of specific amino acids. The order, or sequence, in which the amino acids are connected is also of critical importance. Bradykinin is a nine-amino acid peptide produced in the blood that has the following amino acid sequence: arg-pro-pro-gly-phe-ser-pro-phe-arg This peptide lowers blood pressure, stimulates smooth muscle tissue, increases capillary permeability, and causes pain. When the order of amino acids in bradykinin is reversed, arg-phe-pro-ser-phe-gly-pro-pro-arg the peptide resulting from this synthesis shows none of the activity of bradykinin.

{"prompt":"Question: Which genetic disorder results in the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin?\nOptions:\n A. anemia\nB. albinism\nC. cancers\nD. hyperthyroidism","completion":"albinism\nExplanation: Integumentary System The first thing a clinician sees is the skin, and so the examination of the skin should be part of any thorough physical examination. Most skin disorders are relatively benign, but a few, including melanomas, can be fatal if untreated. A couple of the more noticeable disorders, albinism and vitiligo, affect the appearance of the skin and its accessory organs. Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the individuals so afflicted. Albinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The defect is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to appear white or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV radiation, as they are more prone to sunburns and skin cancer. They also tend to be more sensitive to light and have vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually involves addressing the symptoms, such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the melanocytes in certain areas lose their ability to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction. This leads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10). Neither albinism nor vitiligo directly affects the lifespan of an individual."}
{"prompt":"Question: What describes the way light reflects off of the surface of the mineral?\nOptions:\n A. luster\nB. intensity\nC. density\nD. hardness","completion":"luster\nExplanation: Luster describes the way light reflects off of the surface of the mineral. You might describe diamonds as sparkly or pyrite as shiny. But mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. They first divide minerals into metallic and non-metallic luster. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, like pyrite, are said to have a \u201cmetallic\u201d luster. Minerals with a \u201cnon-metallic\u201d luster do not look like metals. There are many types of non-metallic luster. Six are described below ( Table below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where would you find most pollution of ocean water?\nOptions:\n A. midocean\nB. poles\nC. trenches\nD. coastline","completion":"coastline\nExplanation: Ocean water is most polluted along coasts.

{"prompt":"Question: What monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood?\nOptions:\n A. the lungs\nB. the heart\nC. the brain stem\nD. the kidneys","completion":"the brain stem\nExplanation: The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it \u201ctells\u201d the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range."}

The regulation occurs through signaling between cells and tissues and responses in the form of differential gene expression."}
{"prompt":"Question: The limit to how much solute will dissolve in a given amount of solvent is called what?\nOptions:\n A. density\nB. potency\nC. strength\nD. solubility","completion":"solubility\nExplanation: Solubility There is usually a limit to how much solute will dissolve in a given amount of solvent. This limit is called the solubility of the solute. Some solutes have a very small solubility, while other solutes are soluble in all proportions. Table 9.2 \"Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25\u00b0C (Except as Noted)\" lists the solubilities of various solutes in water. Solubilities vary with temperature, so Table 9.2 \"Solubilities of Various Solutes in Water at 25\u00b0C (Except as Noted)\" includes the temperature at which the solubility was determined.

A synarthrosis is a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in synovial joints."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which part of the brain regulates the rate of breathing?\nOptions:\n A. brain stem\nB. brain stem\nC. brain uptake\nD. brain charge","completion":"brain stem\nExplanation: The rate of breathing is regulated by the brain stem. It monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood and triggers faster or slower breathing as needed to keep the level within a narrow range."}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you decrease errors in an experiment?\nOptions:\n A. take many measurements\nB. write about it\nC. ask God\nD. decrease measurements","completion":"take many measurements\nExplanation: Scientists make many measurements during experiments. Humans and equipment can make mistakes. Errors are often unavoidable. This is called experimental error . Errors may be due to the equipment being used. In this case, the numbers may be always skewed in one direction. For example, a scale may always measure one-half of an ounce high. People can also make errors. A measurement may not be made precisely. For example, a stopwatch may be stopped too soon or too late. But probably not always in the same direction. To correct for this, many measurements are taken. The measurements are then averaged. Experiments always have a margin of error associated with them."}
{"prompt":"Question: Chemical and physical changes in a system may be accompanied by an increase or a decrease in the disorder of the system, corresponding to an increase or decrease in what?\nOptions:\n A. enthalpy\nB. entropy\nC. vibration\nD. volume","completion":"entropy\nExplanation: Chemical and physical changes in a system may be accompanied by either an increase or a decrease in the disorder of the system, corresponding to an increase in entropy (\u0394S> 0) or a decrease in entropy (\u0394S < 0), respectively. As with any other state function, the change in entropy is defined as the difference between the entropies of the final and initial states: \u0394S = Sf \u2212 Si. When a gas expands into a vacuum, its entropy increases because the increased volume allows for greater atomic or molecular disorder. The greater the number of atoms or molecules in the gas, the greater the disorder. The magnitude of the entropy of a system depends on the number of microscopic states, or microstates, associated with it (in this case, the number of atoms or molecules); that is, the greater the number of microstates, the greater the entropy. We can illustrate the concepts of microstates and entropy using a deck of playing cards, as shown in Figure 18.7 \"Illustrating Low- and High-Entropy States with a Deck of Playing Cards\". In any new deck, the 52 cards are arranged by four suits, with each suit arranged in descending order. If the cards are shuffled, however, there are approximately 1068 different ways they might be arranged, which corresponds to 1068different microscopic states. The entropy of an ordered new deck of cards is therefore low, whereas the entropy of a randomly shuffled deck is high. Card games assign a higher value to a hand that has a low degree of disorder. In games such as five-card poker, only 4 of the 2,598,960 different possible hands, or microstates, contain the highly ordered and valued arrangement of cards called a royal flush, almost 1.1 million hands contain one pair, and more than 1.3 million hands are completely disordered and therefore have no value. Because the last two arrangements are far more probable than the first, the value of a poker hand is inversely proportional to its entropy. We can see how to calculate these kinds of probabilities for a chemical system by considering the possible arrangements of a sample of four gas molecules in a two-bulb container (Figure 18.8 \"The Possible Microstates for a Sample of Four Gas Molecules in Two Bulbs of Equal Volume\"). There are five possible arrangements: all four molecules in the left bulb (I); three molecules in the left bulb and one in the right bulb (II); two molecules in each bulb (III); one molecule in the left bulb and three molecules in the right bulb (IV); and four molecules in the right bulb (V). If we assign a different color to each molecule to keep track of it for this discussion (remember, however, that in reality the molecules are indistinguishable from one another), we can see that there are 16 different ways the four molecules can be distributed in the bulbs, each corresponding to a particular microstate. As shown in Figure 18.8 \"The Possible Microstates."}

Tunicates and lancelets are both invertebrates. Altogether, invertebrates make up at least 95 percent of all animal species. The remaining animals are vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone. All vertebrates belong to the phylum Chordata. They include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals."}
{"prompt":"Question: Cell transport refers to the movement of substances across what structure?\nOptions:\n A. cell membrane\nB. cell wall\nC. chloroplasm\nD. phloem","completion":"cell membrane\nExplanation: Cell transport refers to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Probably the most important feature of a cell\u2019s phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable. A membrane that is selectively permeable , or semipermeable, has control over what molecules or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in Figure below . This feature allows a cell to control the transport of materials, as dictated by the cell's function. The permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can stay alive and healthy."}
{"prompt":"Question: In humans, what period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth?\nOptions:\n A. third trimester\nB. plasma period\nC. development period\nD. fetal period","completion":"fetal period\nExplanation: 28.3 Fetal Development The fetal period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth. During this period, male and female gonads differentiate. The fetal circulatory system becomes much more specialized and efficient than its embryonic counterpart. It includes three shunts\u2014the ductus venosus, the foramen ovale, and the ductus arteriosus\u2014that enable it to bypass the semifunctional liver and pulmonary circuit until after childbirth. The brain continues to grow and its structures differentiate. Facial features develop, the body elongates, and the skeleton ossifies. In the womb, the developing fetus moves, blinks, practices sucking, and circulates amniotic fluid. The fetus grows from an embryo measuring approximately 3.3 cm (1.3 in) and weighing 7 g (0.25 oz) to an infant measuring approximately 51 cm (20 in) and weighing an average of approximately 3.4 kg (7.5 lbs). Embryonic organ structures that were primitive and nonfunctional develop to the point that the newborn can survive in the outside world."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the largest taxonomic rank?\nOptions:\n A. sublet\nB. top\nC. domain\nD. core","completion":"domain\nExplanation: Coming up with a scientific naming method may not seem like a big deal, but it really is. Prior to Linnaeus, there was no consistent way to name species. Names given to organisms by scientists were long and cumbersome. Often, different scientists came up with different names for the same species. Common names also differed, generally from one place to another. A single, short scientific name for each species avoided a lot of mistakes and confusion."}
{"prompt":"Question: Batteries produce voltage through what type of reaction?\nOptions:\n A. magnetic\nB. radiation\nC. thermal\nD. chemical","completion":"chemical\nExplanation: Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. A chemical cell has two electrodes, which are strips made of different materials, such as zinc and carbon (see Figure below ). The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. Animations at the URL below show how batteries work."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do we call natural resources that are remade by natural processes as quickly as people use them?\nOptions:\n A. nonrenewable\nB. renewable\nC. exotic\nD. geothermal","completion":"renewable\nExplanation: Renewable resources are natural resources that are remade by natural processes as quickly as people use them. Examples of renewable resources include sunlight and wind. They are in no danger of being used up. Metals and some other minerals are considered renewable as well because they are not destroyed when they are used. Instead, they can be recycled and used over and over again."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are two types of frozen percipitation?\nOptions:\n A. icycles and icebergs\nB. rain and hail\nC. ice and frost\nD. snow and hail","completion":"snow and hail\nExplanation: Snow falls when water vapor condenses as ice crystals. The air temperature is below freezing all the way to the ground, so the ice crystals remain frozen. They fall as flakes. Sleet forms when snow melts as it falls through a layer of warm air and then refreezes. It turns into small, clear ice pellets as it passes through a cold layer near the ground. Freezing rain falls as liquid water. It freezes on contact with cold surfaces near the ground. It may cover everything with a glaze of ice. If the ice is thick, its weight may break tree branches and pull down power lines. Hail is another type of frozen precipitation. Hail forms in thunderstorms when strong updrafts carry rain high into the troposphere. The rain freezes into balls of ice called hailstones. This may happen over and over again until the hailstones are as big as baseballs. Hail forms only in cumulonimbus clouds."}
{"prompt":"Question: When vertebrate animals metabolize ammonia what is the primary byproduct that is produced?\nOptions:\n A. carbon monoxide\nB. urea\nC. dioxide\nD. proteins","completion":"urea\nExplanation: 41.4 Nitrogenous Wastes Ammonia is the waste produced by metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds like proteins and nucleic acids. While aquatic animals can easily excrete ammonia into their watery surroundings, terrestrial animals have evolved special mechanisms to eliminate the toxic ammonia from their systems.

Saturn\nD. uranus","completion":"uranus\nExplanation: All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun. Except for Uranus. Uranus is tilted on its side. Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. So Uranus rolls along like a bowling ball as it revolves around the Sun. How did Uranus get this way? Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over by another planet-sized object. This collision probably took place billions of years ago."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is type of substance is formed when water vapor condenses or when ice melts?\nOptions:\n A. toxic water\nB. chemical water\nC. gaseous water\nD. liquid water","completion":"liquid water\nExplanation: Liquid water is formed when water vapor condenses (i. e. , H 2 O(g) \u2192 H 2 O(l) or when ice melts (i. e. , H 2 O(s) \u2192 H 2 O(l)). Because water is a molecular substance, it is a poor conductor of electricity in its pure form. However, as we will see later, its conductivity can be improved by the addition of certain substances. Water molecules are polar, and this overall polarity gives rise to many of the properties of water. For example, an interesting effect is seen when water is placed in a static electric field, as shown in the Figure below and the video below. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the polarity of water molecules."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the wavelength of light expressed in?\nOptions:\n A. nanometers (nm)\nB. nanoseconds\nC. millimeters\nD. vatts","completion":"nanometers (nm)\nExplanation: Light As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium\u2014a gas, a liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum (Figure 36.16). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light\u2014a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light. Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency) manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off)."}

One way viruses cause disease is by causing host cells to burst open and die. Viruses may also cause disease without killing host cells. They may cause illness by disrupting homeostasis in host cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do crystals have relatively sharp and well-defined melting points?\nOptions:\n A. uniform intermolecular forces\nB. particular intermolecular forces\nC. variable intermolecular forces\nD. angular intermolecular forces","completion":"uniform intermolecular forces\nExplanation: Deformation of the ionic crystal causes one plane of atoms to slide along another. The resulting repulsive interactions between ions with like charges cause the layers to separate. Crystals tend to have relatively sharp, well-defined melting points because all the component atoms, molecules, or ions are the same distance from the same number and type of neighbors; that is, the regularity of the crystalline lattice creates local environments that are the same. Thus the intermolecular forces holding the solid together are uniform, and the same amount of thermal energy is needed to break every interaction simultaneously. Amorphous solids have two characteristic properties. When cleaved or broken, they produce fragments with irregular, often curved surfaces; and they have poorly defined patterns when exposed to x-rays because their components are not arranged in a regular array. An amorphous, translucent solid is called a glass. Almost any substance can solidify."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which parasite causes downy mildew in grape plants?\nOptions:\n A. taphrina confusa\nB. epichloe typhina\nC. plasmopara viticola\nD. chrysomyxa ledi","completion":"plasmopara viticola\nExplanation: Plant Parasites Protist parasites of terrestrial plants include agents that destroy food crops. The oomycete Plasmopara viticola parasitizes grape plants, causing a disease called downy mildew (Figure 13.18a).

An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues."}

{"prompt":"Question: What helps an insectivorous plant attract and digest insects?\nOptions:\n A. specialized leaves\nB. specialized flowers\nC. special seeds\nD. spines","completion":"specialized leaves\nExplanation: Insectivorous Plants An insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects. The Venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition, and has leaves that work as traps (Figure 31.16). The minerals it obtains from prey compensate for those lacking in the boggy (low pH) soil of its native North Carolina coastal plains. There are three sensitive hairs in the center of each half of each leaf. The edges of each leaf are covered with long spines. Nectar secreted by the plant attracts flies to the leaf. When a fly touches the sensory hairs, the leaf immediately closes. Next, fluids and enzymes break down the prey and minerals are absorbed by the leaf. Since this plant is popular in the horticultural trade, it is threatened in its original habitat."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is another term for nearsightedness?\nOptions:\n A. hypoxia\nB. glaucoma\nC. myopia\nD. anemia","completion":"myopia\nExplanation: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects are blurry.

{"prompt":"Question: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, what carries it away?\nOptions:\n A. carbon ?\nB. runoff?\nC. fossils\nD. clouds","completion":"runoff?\nExplanation: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U. S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf."}

{"prompt":"Question: Conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms, with the most variety of species. most are tall trees that usually bear scale-like or needle-like leaves. the thin shape of the needles and their waxy cuticle limits water loss through this?\nOptions:\n A. evaporation\nB. transpiration\nC. transportation\nD. sedimentation","completion":"transpiration\nExplanation: Conifers Conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms, with the most variety of species. Most are tall trees that usually bear scale-like or needle-like leaves. The thin shape of the needles and their waxy cuticle limits water loss through transpiration. Snow slides easily off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the load light and decreasing breaking of branches. These adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates. Conifers include familiar evergreen trees, such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews (Figure 14.20). A few species are deciduous and lose their leaves all at once in fall. The European larch and the tamarack are examples of deciduous conifers. Many coniferous trees are harvested for paper pulp and timber. The wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood of angiosperms; it contains tracheids, but no vessel elements, and is referred to as \u201csoft wood."}

{"prompt":"Question: Passive immunity arises from the transfer of what to an individual, without requiring them to mount their own active immune response?\nOptions:\n A. parasites\nB. bacteria\nC. antibodies\nD. viruses","completion":"antibodies\nExplanation: Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to which she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory.

{"prompt":"Question: Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of what?\nOptions:\n A. earthquakes\nB. hurricanes\nC. eruptions\nD. tornados","completion":"hurricanes\nExplanation: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is name for a piece of collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin?\nOptions:\n A. tissue\nB. Sore\nC. scar\nD. size","completion":"scar\nExplanation: Scars and Keloids Most cuts or wounds, with the exception of ones that only scratch the surface (the epidermis), lead to scar formation. A scar is collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin. Scarring occurs in cases in which there is repair of skin damage, but the skin fails to regenerate the original skin structure. Fibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen, and the bulk of repair is due to the basket-weave pattern generated by collagen fibers and does not result in regeneration of the typical cellular structure of skin. Instead, the tissue is fibrous in nature and does not allow for the regeneration of accessory structures, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, or sebaceous glands. Sometimes, there is an overproduction of scar tissue, because the process of collagen formation does not stop when the wound is healed; this results in the formation of a raised or hypertrophic scar called a keloid. In contrast, scars that result from acne and chickenpox have a sunken appearance and are called atrophic scars. Scarring of skin after wound healing is a natural process and does not need to be treated further. Application of mineral oil and lotions may reduce the formation of scar tissue. However, modern cosmetic procedures, such as dermabrasion, laser treatments, and filler injections have been invented as remedies for severe scarring. All of these procedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and underlying collagen tissue to make it look more natural."}
{"prompt":"Question: Culprits in the common cold and aids, what infectious agents are far smaller and simpler than bacteria?\nOptions:\n A. poisons\nB. pathogens\nC. parasites\nD. viruses","completion":"viruses\nExplanation: Infectious diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and are among the most significant health problems in our society. Viruses are infectious agents far smaller and simpler than bacteria that are composed of a tightly packed central core of nucleic acids enclosed in a protective shell. The shell consists of layers of one or more proteins and may also have lipid or carbohydrate molecules on the surface. Because of their simplicity, viruses must invade the cells of other organisms to be able to reproduce. Viruses are visible only under an electron microscope. They come in a variety of shapes, ranging from spherical to rod shaped. The fact that they contain either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)\u2014but never both\u2014allows them to be divided into two major classes: DNA viruses and RNA viruses (Figure 19.17 \"Viruses\").

{"prompt":"Question: How many times does the height of the largest wave increase with each level?\nOptions:\n A. 20 times\nB. 100 times\nC. 5 times\nD. 10 times","completion":"10 times\nExplanation: Richter scale magnitudes jump from one level to the next. The height of the largest wave increases 10 times with each level. So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake. A magnitude 5 is 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. With each level, thirty times more energy is released. A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900 times more released energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do homonuclear diatomic molecules have zero dipole moment?\nOptions:\n A. no electrical attraction\nB. no difference in electronegativity\nC. no activation energy\nD. at homeostasis","completion":"no difference in electronegativity\nExplanation: A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure. For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity. When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO2 (Figure 7.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 7.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however,."}
{"prompt":"Question: Our digestive system breaks down starch to what?\nOptions:\n A. Salts\nB.

{"prompt":"Question: Atmospheric pressure is increased, causing a greater amount of oxygen than normal to diffuse into the bloodstream of the patient, in what type of therapy?\nOptions:\n A. hyperbaric chamber therapy\nB. Distinct Chamber Therapy\nC. politic chamber therapy\nD. ventilation chamber therapy","completion":"hyperbaric chamber therapy\nExplanation: Hyperbaric chamber treatment is based on the behavior of gases. As you recall, gases move from a region of higher partial pressure to a region of lower partial pressure. In a hyperbaric chamber, the atmospheric pressure is increased, causing a greater amount of oxygen than normal to diffuse into the bloodstream of the patient. Hyperbaric chamber therapy is used to treat a variety of medical problems, such as wound and graft healing, anaerobic bacterial infections, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Exposure to and poisoning by carbon monoxide is difficult to reverse, because hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its affinity for oxygen, causing carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. Hyperbaric chamber therapy can treat carbon monoxide poisoning, because the increased atmospheric pressure causes more oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream. At this increased pressure and increased concentration of oxygen, carbon monoxide is displaced from hemoglobin. Another example is the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, which are created by bacteria that cannot or prefer not to live in the presence of oxygen. An increase in blood and tissue levels of oxygen helps to kill the anaerobic bacteria that are responsible for the infection, as oxygen is toxic to anaerobic bacteria. For wounds and grafts, the chamber stimulates the healing process by increasing energy production needed for repair. Increasing oxygen transport allows cells to ramp up cellular respiration and thus ATP production, the energy needed to build new structures."}

{"prompt":"Question: The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three german scientists bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving what?\nOptions:\n A. protons\nB. electrons\nC. isotopes\nD. neutrons","completion":"neutrons\nExplanation: Nuclear Fission Many heavier elements with smaller binding energies per nucleon can decompose into more stable elements that have intermediate mass numbers and larger binding energies per nucleon\u2014that is, mass numbers and binding energies per nucleon that are closer to the \u201cpeak\u201d of the binding energy graph near 56 (see Figure 21.3). Sometimes neutrons are also produced. This decomposition is called fission, the breaking of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. The breaking is rather random with the formation of a large number of different products. Fission usually does not occur naturally, but is induced by bombardment with neutrons. The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three German scientists, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving neutrons that split the U-238 nuclei into smaller fragments that consisted of several neutrons and elements near the middle of the periodic table. Since then, fission has been observed in many other isotopes, including most actinide isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons. A typical nuclear fission reaction is shown in Figure 21.14."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction?\nOptions:\n A. a battery\nB. a windmill\nC. a diesel engine\nD. an electric generator","completion":"an electric generator\nExplanation: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that\u2019s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works."}

{"prompt":"Question: Where does the majority of chemical digestion occur?\nOptions:\n A. stomach\nB. mouth\nC. small intestine\nD. large intestine","completion":"small intestine\nExplanation: Chemical digestion occurs when large food molecules are broken down into smaller nutrient molecules. This is a chemical process that begins in the mouth and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine."}
{"prompt":"Question: During what in the small intestine do rings of smooth muscle repeatedly contract and then relax?\nOptions:\n A. segmentation\nB. mitosis\nC. contraction\nD. compression","completion":"segmentation\nExplanation: Mechanical Digestion in the Small Intestine The movement of intestinal smooth muscles includes both segmentation and a form of peristalsis called migrating motility complexes. The kind of peristaltic mixing waves seen in the stomach are not observed here. If you could see into the small intestine when it was going through segmentation, it would look as if the contents were being shoved incrementally back and forth, as the rings of smooth muscle repeatedly contract and then relax. Segmentation in the small intestine does not force chyme through the tract. Instead, it combines the chyme with digestive juices and pushes food particles against the mucosa to be absorbed. The duodenum is where the most rapid segmentation occurs, at a rate of about 12 times per minute. In the ileum, segmentations are only about eight times per minute (Figure 23.20)."}

If the word Salmonella rings a bell, that\u2019s probably because Salmonella causes human diseases such as food poisoning. Many other types of bacteria also cause human diseases. But not all bacteria are harmful to people. In fact, we could not survive without many of the trillions of bacteria that live in or on the human body. You will learn why when you read this chapter."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the ratio of a wave frequency to its vibration frequency?\nOptions:\n A. one\nB. same\nC. two\nD. three","completion":"same\nExplanation: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them. )."}
{"prompt":"Question: The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. refraction\nB. bounce\nC. frequency\nD. resonance","completion":"refraction\nExplanation: The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That\u2019s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water."}

{"prompt":"Question: All lipids have two distinct domains, a hydrophobic and a what?\nOptions:\n A. hydroceptive\nB. hydrophilic\nC. covalent\nD. hydroaversive","completion":"hydrophilic\nExplanation: Membrane boundaries and capturing energy In which we consider how the aqueous nature of biological systems drives the formation of lipidbased barrier membranes and how such membranes are used to capture and store energy from the environment and chemical reactions. We consider how coupled reactions are used to drive macromolecular synthesis and growth. Defining the cell\u2019s boundary A necessary step in the origin of life was the generation of a discrete barrier, a boundary layer, that serves to separate the living non-equilibrium reaction system from the rest of the universe. This boundary layer, the structural ancestor of the plasma membrane of modern cells, serves to maintain the integrity of the living system and mediates the movement of materials and energy into and out of the cell. Based on our current observations, the plasma membrane of all modern cells appears to be a homologous structure derived from a precursor present in the last common ancestor of life. So what is the structure of this barrier (plasma) membrane? How is it built and how does it work? When a new cell is formed its plasma membrane is derived from the plasma membrane of the progenitor cell. As the cell grows, new molecules must be added into the membrane to enable it to increase its surface area. Biological membranes are composed of two general classes of molecules, proteins (which we will discuss in much greater detail in the next section of the course) and lipids. It is worth noting explicitly here that, unlike a number of other types of molecules we will be considering, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, lipids are not a structurally coherent group, that is they do not have one particular basic structure. Structurally diverse molecules, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, are both considered lipids. While there is a relatively small set of common lipid types, there are many different lipids found in biological systems and the characterization of their structure and function(s) has led to a new area of specialization known as lipidomics.214 All lipids have two distinct domains: a hydrophilic (circled in red in this figure \u2192) domain characterized by polar regions and one or more hydrophobic\/hydroapathetic domains that are usually made up of C and H and are non-polar. Lipids are amphipathic. In aqueous solution, entropic effects will drive the hydrophobic\/hydroapathetic parts of the lipid out of aqueous solution. But in contrast to totally non-polar molecules, like oils, the hydrophobic\/hydroapathetic part of the lipid is connected to a hydrophilic domain that is soluble in 214."}

{"prompt":"Question: Protecting the surface of metal prevents what?\nOptions:\n A. extraction\nB. corrosion\nC. diffusion\nD. evaporation","completion":"corrosion\nExplanation: One way to prevent corrosion is to protect the surface of the metal. Covering the surface of the metal object with paint or oil will prevent corrosion by not allowing oxygen to contact it. Unfortunately, scratches in the paint or wearing off of the oil will allow the corrosion to begin. Corrosion-sensitive metals can also be coated with another metal that is resistant to corrosion. A \u201ctin can\u201d is actually made of iron coated with a thin layer of tin which protects the iron."}

{"prompt":"Question: The net effect of aldosterone is to conserve and increase water levels in the plasma by reducing the excretion of what element, and thus water?\nOptions:\n A. sodium\nB. oxygen\nC. potassium\nD. lithium","completion":"sodium\nExplanation: Aldosterone Recall that aldosterone increases the excretion of potassium and the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule. Aldosterone is released if blood levels of potassium increase, if blood levels of sodium severely decrease, or if blood pressure decreases. Its net effect is to conserve and increase water levels in the plasma by reducing the excretion of sodium, and thus water, from the kidneys. In a negative feedback loop, increased osmolality of the ECF (which follows aldosterone-stimulated sodium absorption) inhibits the release of the hormone (Figure 26.13)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Technetium is named after the greektechnikos, meaning \u201cartificial,\u201d because all its isotopes are what?\nOptions:\n A. rare\nB. plastic\nC. radioactive\nD. neutral","completion":"radioactive\nExplanation: Group 7 (Mn, Tc, and Re) Continuing across the periodic table, we encounter the group 7 elements (Table 23.5 \"Some Properties of the Elements of Groups 6 and 7\"). One group 7 metal (Mn) is usually combined with iron in an alloy called ferromanganese, which has been used since 1856 to improve the mechanical properties of steel by scavenging sulfur and oxygen impurities to form MnS and MnO. Technetium is named after the Greektechnikos, meaning \u201cartificial,\u201d because all its isotopes are radioactive. One isotope, 99mTc (m for metastable), has become an important biomedical tool for imaging internal organs. (For more information on biomedical imaging, see Chapter 20 \"Nuclear Chemistry\", Section 20.5 \"Applied Nuclear Chemistry\". ) Because of its scarcity, Re is one of the most expensive elements, and its applications are limited. It is, however, used in a bimetallic Pt\/Re catalyst for refining high-octane gasoline. All three group 7 elements have seven valence electrons and can form compounds in the +7 oxidation state. Once again, the lightest element exhibits multiple oxidation states. Compounds of Mn in oxidation states ranging from \u22123 to +7 are known, with the most common being +2 and +4 (Figure 23.5 \"Compounds of Manganese in Oxidation States +2 to +7\"). In contrast, compounds of Tc and Re in the +2 oxidation state are quite rare. Because the electronegativity of Mn is anomalously low, elemental manganese is unusually reactive. In contrast, the chemistry of Tc is similar to that of Re because of their similar size and electronegativity, again a result of the lanthanide contraction. Due to the stability of the half-filled 3d5 electron configuration, the aqueous Mn3+ ion, with a 3d4 valence electron configuration, is a potent oxidant that is able to oxidize water. It is difficult to generalize about other oxidation states for Tc and Re because their stability depends dramatically on the nature of the compound. Consistent with higher oxidation states being more stable for the heavier transition metals, reacting Mn with F2 gives only MnF3, a high-melting, red-purple solid, whereas Re reacts with F 2 to give ReF7, a volatile, low-melting, yellow solid. Again, reaction with the less oxidizing, heavier halogens produces halides in lower oxidation states. Thus reaction with Cl 2, a weaker oxidant than F2, gives MnCl2 and ReCl6."}

{"prompt":"Question: A fact or question is only considered science if it has what property?\nOptions:\n A. it is interesting\nB. it is mineral\nC. it is believable\nD. it is testable","completion":"it is testable\nExplanation: Note the word science in that last sentence. Earth Science is a science, or maybe it\u2019s made up of a lot of sciences. But what is science? Most people think of science as a bunch of knowledge. And it is. But science is also a way of knowing things. It\u2019s different from other ways of knowing because it is based on a method that relies on observations and data. Science can\u2019t say how many angels can dance on the end of a pin because that question can\u2019t be tested. In fact, science can\u2019t even say if there are such things as angels for the same reason. For something to be science, it must be testable. And scientists are the people who do those tests."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because of the wave character of matter, the idea of well-defined orbits gives way to a model in which there is a cloud of what?\nOptions:\n A. particles\nB. mutation\nC. chaos\nD. probability","completion":"probability\nExplanation: Because of the wave character of matter, the idea of well-defined orbits gives way to a model in which there is a cloud of probability, consistent with Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. Figure 30.48 shows how this applies to the ground state of hydrogen. If you try to follow the electron in some well-defined orbit using a probe that has a small enough wavelength to get some details, you will instead knock the electron out of its orbit. Each measurement of the electron\u2019s position will find it to be in a definite location somewhere near the nucleus. Repeated measurements reveal a cloud of probability like that in the figure, with each speck the location determined by a single measurement. There is not a well-defined, circular-orbit type of distribution. Nature again proves to be different on a small scale than on a macroscopic scale."}

{"prompt":"Question: Boyle discovered that what property of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume?\nOptions:\n A. temperature\nB. pressure\nC. amount\nD. mass","completion":"pressure\nExplanation: in a one-liter container (Figure 22.15). In this case, the force exerted by the movement of the gas molecules against the walls of the two-liter container is lower than the force exerted by the gas molecules in the one-liter container. Therefore, the pressure is lower in the two-liter container and higher in the one-liter container. At a constant temperature, changing the volume occupied by the gas changes the pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules. Boyle\u2019s law describes the relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If volume increases, pressure decreases. Likewise, if volume decreases, pressure increases. Pressure and volume are inversely related (P = k\/V). Therefore, the pressure in the one-liter container (one-half the volume of the two-liter container) would be twice the pressure in the two-liter container. Boyle\u2019s law is expressed by the following formula:."}

Over time, this internal radon exposure can lead to the development of lung cancer. The incidence of lung cancer in smokers exposed to radon is much higher than that in non-smokers exposed to radon since smoking has already produced some lung damage, and the radon simply makes the damage worse. Radon exposure is highest in homes lacking good air circulation to move the gas out of the residence. There are a number of inexpensive approaches to decreasing your exposure to radon. A good start is to test your living area for radon with a radon test kit."}

{"prompt":"Question: The cathode and anode collectively are the electrodes of what?\nOptions:\n A. circuit cell\nB. switch cell\nC. photo cell\nD. voltaic cell","completion":"voltaic cell\nExplanation: One application of redox reactions requires that they be physically separated. Even though the two half reactions are physically separated, a spontaneous redox reaction still occurs. However, in this case, the electrons transfer through the wire connecting the two half reactions; that is, this setup becomes a source of electricity. Useful work can be extracted from the electrons as they transfer from one side to the other\u2014for example, a light bulb can be lit, or a motor can be operated. The apparatus as a whole, which allows useful electrical work to be extracted from a redox reaction, is called a voltaic (galvanic) cell. Each individual system that contains a half reaction is called a half cell. The half cell that contains the oxidation reaction is called the anode, while the half cell that contains the reduction reaction is called the cathode. The cathode and anode collectively are the electrodes of the voltaic cell. Because electrons are coming from the anode, the anode is considered the negative electrode of the cell, while the cathode is considered the positive electrode of the cell. Finally, because electrons are moving from one half cell to the."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for longer chains of monosaccharides ?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. hydrocarbons\nC. oligosaccharides\nD. polysaccharides","completion":"polysaccharides\nExplanation: Longer chains of monosaccharides are referred to as polysaccharides . Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are three extremely common polysaccharides made entirely out of glucose molecules. The differences lie in the types of bonds between the glucose units and the extent of branching in the carbohydrate chain. Starch is found in plants and is consumed as part of our diet. Glycogen is made by the body and is a storage form of glucose for when the cells need extra energy. Cellulose is another long-chain polysaccharide found in plants. Unlike starch and glycogen, the human body cannot break cellulose down into molecules of glucose. Although cellulose does not have any nutritional value in terms of calories, it is a major component of dietary fiber, which has other digestive benefits."}

{"prompt":"Question: What play an important role in the modulation of the nuclear chain reaction?\nOptions:\n A. radiation rods\nB. control neutrons\nC. particle rods\nD. control rods","completion":"control rods\nExplanation: The control rods play an important role in the modulation of the nuclear chain reaction (usually a collision of a neutron with uranium). Each collision produces more neutrons than were present initially. If left unsupervised, the reaction would soon get out of control. Rods are commonly made of boron or a number of metals and metal alloys. The purpose of the control rods is to absorb neutrons to regulate the rate of the chain reaction so that the water does not overheat and destroy the reactor."}

{"prompt":"Question: What organizational tool, arguably the best in all of science, lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number?\nOptions:\n A. tide table\nB. logic table\nC. spreadsheet\nD. periodic table","completion":"periodic table\nExplanation: Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements In this chapter, we present some data on the chemical elements. The periodic table, introduced in Chapter 3 \"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\", lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number (that is, the number of protons in the nucleus). The periodic table is arguably the best tool in all of science; no other branch of science can summarize its fundamental constituents in such a concise and useful way. Many of the physical and chemical properties of the elements are either known or understood based on their positions on the periodic table. Periodic tables are available with a variety of chemical and physical properties listed in each element\u2019s box. What follows here is a more complex version of the periodic table than what was presented inChapter 3 \"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\". The Internet is a great place to find periodic tables that contain additional information. One item on most periodic tables is the atomic mass of each element. For many applications, only one or two decimal places are necessary for the atomic mass. However, some applications (especially nuclear chemistry; see Chapter 15 \"Nuclear Chemistry\") require more decimal places. The atomic masses in Table 17.1 \"The Basics of the Elements of the Periodic Table\" represent the number of decimal places recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the worldwide body that develops standards for chemistry. The atomic masses of some elements are known very precisely, to a large number of decimal places. The atomic masses of other elements, especially radioactive elements, are not known as precisely. Some elements, such as lithium, can have varying atomic masses depending on how their isotopes are isolated. The web offers many interactive periodic table resources. For example, seehttp:\/\/www. ptable."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does photosynthesis not occur in the deep-water zone?\nOptions:\n A. it is cold\nB. it is pressurized\nC. it is dark\nD. it is stagnant","completion":"it is dark\nExplanation: The deep-water zone is dark so there is no photosynthesis.

{"prompt":"Question: Species that have diverged from their common ancestors have greater differences in what?\nOptions:\n A. life span\nB. dna sequence\nC. cell structure\nD. immunology","completion":"dna sequence\nExplanation: Evidence from the fossil record can be combined with data from molecular clocks. A molecular clock uses DNA sequences (or the proteins they encode) to estimate relatedness among species. Molecular clocks estimate the time in geologic history when related species diverged from a common ancestor. Molecular clocks are based on the assumption that mutations accumulate through time at a steady average rate for a given region of DNA. Species that have accumulated greater differences in their DNA sequences are assumed to have diverged from their common ancestor in the more distant past. Molecular clocks based on different regions of DNA may be used together for more accuracy."}

In the real world, there is a decay chain that takes place until a stable end-product is produced. For U-238, the chain is a long one, with a mix of isotopes having very different half-lives. The end of the chain resides in lead, a stable element that does not decay further."}
{"prompt":"Question: What doctors specialize in diseases stemming from glandular issues?\nOptions:\n A. anthropologists\nB. dermatologists\nC. endocrinologists\nD. oncologists","completion":"endocrinologists\nExplanation: Endocrinologist An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands, hormone systems, and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves\u2019 disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing\u2019s disease and Addison\u2019s disease). Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time. Once a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and\/or medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections. In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections."}

It has a a gentle slope. The water over the continental shelf is shallow."}
{"prompt":"Question: What consists of the different species within an area?\nOptions:\n A. abundant community\nB. science community\nC. biological community\nD. contamination community","completion":"biological community\nExplanation: Community Ecology A biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the interactions within and among these species. Community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions and their consequences. Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource. Ecologists also study interactions among various species; members of different species are called heterospecifics. Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and pollination. These interactions can have regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary processes affecting diversity. For example, Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants. Mutualism is a form of a longterm relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits. For mutualism to exist between individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the relationship. Researchers have shown that there is an increase in the probability of survival when Karner blue butterfly larvae (caterpillars) are tended by ants. This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended by ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae. Meanwhile, the Karner blue butterfly larvae secrete a carbohydraterich substance that is an important energy source for the ants. Both the Karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their interaction."}

{"prompt":"Question: Both sexes of sockeye salmon turn red with green heads just prior to what?\nOptions:\n A. dying\nB. spawning\nC. feeding\nD. migrating","completion":"spawning\nExplanation: Wild male and female Sockeye salmon before spawning. Sockeye salmon are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. Just prior to spawning, both sexes turn red with green heads. Sockeye spawn mostly in streams having lakes in their watershed. The young fish spend up to three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean. Migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are four to six years old when they return to spawn. Navigation to the home river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the stream, and possibly the sun."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the arrangement of veins in a leaf?\nOptions:\n A. dorsal pattern\nB. vein pattern\nC. venation pattern\nD. cerebellum pattern","completion":"venation pattern\nExplanation: Within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern. Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 30.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, the Ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork."}

{"prompt":"Question: What weather phenomenon increases the rate of weathering in rock and soil?\nOptions:\n A. temperature\nB. earthquake\nC. rainfall\nD. landslide","completion":"rainfall\nExplanation: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering."}
{"prompt":"Question: The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a what?\nOptions:\n A. primordial follicle\nB. corpus luteum\nC. liberated ovum\nD. secondary ovum","completion":"corpus luteum\nExplanation: Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in Figure 43.15 and the menstrual cycle enters its secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days. If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again. Figure 43.17 visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone levels."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment?\nOptions:\n A. botany\nB. zoology\nC. genetics\nD. ecology","completion":"ecology\nExplanation: Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. But how do organisms interact with each other? Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms, one of which is competition. Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different species (interspecific)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between the diaphragm and these?\nOptions:\n A. heart muscles\nB. abdominal muscles\nC. skeletal muscles\nD. lung muscles","completion":"abdominal muscles\nExplanation: Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles (this cooperation is referred to as the \u201cValsalva maneuver\u201d). You hold your breath by a steady contraction of the diaphragm; this stabilizes the volume and pressure of the peritoneal cavity. When the abdominal muscles contract, the pressure cannot push the diaphragm up, so it increases pressure on the intestinal tract (defecation), urinary tract (urination), or reproductive tract (childbirth). The inferior surface of the pericardial sac and the inferior surfaces of the pleural membranes (parietal pleura) fuse onto the central tendon of the diaphragm. To the sides of the tendon are the skeletal muscle portions of the diaphragm, which insert into the tendon while having a number of origins including the xiphoid process of the sternum anteriorly, the inferior six ribs and their cartilages laterally, and the lumbar vertebrae and 12th ribs posteriorly. The diaphragm also includes three openings for the passage of structures between the thorax and the abdomen. The inferior vena cava passes through the caval opening, and the esophagus and attached nerves pass through the esophageal hiatus. The aorta, thoracic duct, and azygous vein pass through the aortic hiatus of the posterior diaphragm."}

{"prompt":"Question: As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body\u2019s air pockets in the ears and lungs to do what?\nOptions:\n A. heat up\nB. compress\nC. expand\nD. blow up","completion":"compress\nExplanation: from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body\u2019s air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in his BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle\u2019s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and she or he begins to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface."}

{"prompt":"Question: \"direct\" and \"alternating\" are two kinds of what, which is associated with electricity?\nOptions:\n A. time\nB. constant\nC. current\nD. levels","completion":"current\nExplanation: 20.5 Alternating Current versus Direct Current Alternating Current Most of the examples dealt with so far, and particularly those utilizing batteries, have constant voltage sources. Once the current is established, it is thus also a constant. Direct current (DC) is the flow of electric charge in only one direction. It is the steady state of a constant-voltage circuit. Most well-known applications, however, use a time-varying voltage source. Alternating current (AC) is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction. If the source varies periodically, particularly sinusoidally, the circuit is known as an alternating current circuit. Examples include the commercial and residential power that."}
{"prompt":"Question: During what phase of breathing does the pressure inside the lungs drops to below atmospheric pressure?\nOptions:\n A. conduction\nB. exhalation\nC. inhalation\nD. ingestion","completion":"inhalation\nExplanation: Pressure Associated with the Lungs The pressure inside the lungs increases and decreases with each breath. The pressure drops to below atmospheric pressure (negative gauge pressure) when you inhale, causing air to flow into the lungs. It increases above atmospheric pressure (positive gauge pressure) when you exhale, forcing air out. Lung pressure is controlled by several mechanisms. Muscle action in the diaphragm and rib cage is necessary for inhalation; this muscle action increases the volume of the lungs thereby reducing the pressure within them Figure 11.39. Surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive pressure opposing inhalation. (See Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action. ) You can exhale without muscle action by letting surface tension in the alveoli create its own positive pressure. Muscle action can add to this positive pressure to produce forced exhalation, such as when you blow up a balloon, blow out a candle, or cough."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for biologically meaningful dna sequences?\nOptions:\n A. genes\nB. atoms\nC. eggs\nD. babies","completion":"genes\nExplanation: disease is sex-linked and effects mainly males (who are XY, compared to XX females).273 In the unaffected population, the FMR-1 gene contains between 6 to 50 copies of a CGG repeat. Individuals with between 6 to 50 repeats are phenotypically normal. Those with 50 to 200 repeats carry what is known as a pre-mutation; these individuals rarely display symptoms but can transmit the disease to their children. Those with more than 200 repeats typically display symptoms and often have what appears to be a broken X chromosome \u2013 from which the disease derives its name. The pathogenic sequence in Fragile X is downstream of the FMR1 gene's coding region. When this region expands, it inhibits the gene's activity. 274 Other DNA Defects: Defects in DNA repair can lead to severe diseases and often a susceptibility to cancer. A OMIM search for DNA repair returns 654 entries! For example, defects in mismatch repair lead to a susceptibility to colon cancer, while defects in translation-coupled DNA repair are associated with Cockayne syndrome. People with Cockayne's syndrome are sensitive to light, short and appear to age prematurely.275 Summary: Our introduction to genes has necessarily been quite foundational. There are lots of variations and associated complexities that occur within the biological world. The key ideas are that genes represent biologically meaningful DNA sequences. To be meaningful, the sequence must play a role within the organism, typically by encoding a gene product (which we will consider next) and\/or the information needed to insure its correct \u201cexpression\u201d, that is, where and when the information in the gene is used. A practical problem is that most studies of genes are carried out using organisms grown in the lab or in otherwise artificial or unnatural conditions. It might be possible for an organism to exist with an amorphic mutation in a gene in the lab, whereas organisms that carry that allele may well be at a significant reproductive disadvantage in the real world. Moreover, a particular set of alleles, a particular genotype, might have a reproductive advantage in one environment (one ecological\/ behavioral niche) but not another. Measuring these effects can be difficult. All of which should serve as a warning to consider skeptically pronouncements that a gene, or more accurately a specific allele of a gene, is responsible for a certain trait, particularly if the trait is complex, ill-defined, and likely to be significantly influenced by genomic context (the rest of the genotype) and environmental factors. Questions to answer & to ponder: \u2022 What happens in cells with defects in DNA repair systems when they attempt to divide? \u2022 I thought RNA primers were used to make DNA! So why is there no uracil in a DNA molecule? \u2022 A base is lost, how is this loss recognized by repair systems? \u2022 How could a DNA duplication lead to the production of a totally new gene (rather than just two copies of a pre-existing gene)? \u2022 How does a mutation generate a new allele? And what exactly is the difference between a gene and an allele? 273."}

Number of neutrons","completion":"number of protons\nExplanation: In the modern periodic table, elements are organized by atomic number. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom of an element. This number is unique for each element, so it seems like an obvious way to organize the elements. (Mendeleev used atomic mass instead of atomic number because protons had not yet been discovered when he made his table. ) In the modern table, atomic number increases from left to right across each period. It also increases from top to bottom within each group. How is this like Mendeleev\u2019s table?."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which theory describes the benzene molecule and other planar aromatic hydrocarbon molecules as hexagonal rings of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with the unhybridized p orbital of each carbon atom perpendicular to the plane of the ring?\nOptions:\n A. valence bond theory\nB. hybrid orbital theory\nC. covalent bond theory\nD. molecular orbital theory","completion":"valence bond theory\nExplanation: Valence bond theory describes the benzene molecule and other planar aromatic hydrocarbon molecules as hexagonal rings of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with the unhybridized p orbital of each carbon atom perpendicular to the plane of the ring. Three valence electrons in the sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom and the valence electron of each hydrogen atom form the framework of \u03c3 bonds in the benzene molecule. The fourth valence electron of each carbon atom is shared with an adjacent carbon atom in their unhybridized p orbitals to yield the \u03c0 bonds. Benzene does not, however, exhibit the characteristics typical of an alkene. Each of the six bonds between its carbon atoms is equivalent and exhibits properties that are intermediate between those of a C\u2013C single bond and a C = C double bond. To represent this unique bonding, structural formulas for benzene and its derivatives are typically drawn with single bonds between the carbon atoms and a circle within the ring as shown in Figure 20.11."}
{"prompt":"Question: The smallest unit of structure and function in all living organisms is what?\nOptions:\n A. mineral\nB. compound\nC. cell\nD. particle","completion":"cell\nExplanation: The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not. Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism. The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, defines the life of an eukaryotic cell."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do sudoriferous glands secrete?\nOptions:\n A. water\nB. moving\nC. tissue\nD. sweat","completion":"sweat\nExplanation: Sweat Glands When the body becomes warm, sudoriferous glands produce sweat to cool the body. Sweat glands develop from epidermal projections into the dermis and are classified as merocrine glands; that is, the secretions are excreted by exocytosis through a duct without affecting the cells of the gland. There are two types of sweat glands, each secreting slightly different products. An eccrine sweat gland is type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are found all over the skin\u2019s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the forehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin surface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly of water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine glands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis."}

For example, molarity was introduced in as a useful way to describe solution concentrations for reactions that are carried out in solution. Mole fractions, introduced in , are used not only to describe gas concentrations but also to determine the vapor pressures of mixtures of similar liquids. Example 4 reviews the methods for calculating the molarity and mole fraction of a solution when the masses of its components are known."}
{"prompt":"Question: When menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease; this is called?\nOptions:\n A. climax\nB. hormonal imbalance\nC. menopause\nD. metabolic","completion":"menopause\nExplanation: Which of the following statements about the menstrual cycle is false? a. Progesterone levels rise during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle and the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. Menstruation occurs just after LH and FSH levels peak. Menstruation occurs after progesterone levels drop. Estrogen levels rise before ovulation, while progesterone levels rise after. Menopause As women approach their mid-40s to mid-50s, their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH. Menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease; this is menopause. There are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries, but without the stimulation of FSH and LH, they will not produce a viable egg to be released. The outcome of this is the inability to have children. The side effects of menopause include hot flashes, heavy sweating (especially at night), headaches, some hair loss, muscle pain, vaginal dryness, insomnia, depression, weight gain, and mood swings. Estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism and, without it, blood levels of calcium decrease. To replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease the bone density and lead to osteoporosis. Supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent bone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects. While HRT is thought to give some protection from colon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include increased risk of: stroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease, and possibly dementia."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term means that only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity or charge are capable of passing through the material?\nOptions:\n A. selective permeation\nB. classic permeation\nC. induced permeation\nD. radiation permeation","completion":"selective permeation\nExplanation: Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable membranes. Consider the apparatus illustrated in Figure 11.25, in which samples of pure solvent and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate. Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis."}

{"prompt":"Question: Lipids are available to the body from how many sources?\nOptions:\n A. one\nB. three\nC. five\nD. two","completion":"three\nExplanation: 24.3 Lipid Metabolism Lipids are available to the body from three sources. They can be ingested in the diet, stored in the adipose tissue of the body, or synthesized in the liver. Fats ingested in the diet are digested in the small intestine. The triglycerides are broken down into monoglycerides and free fatty acids, then imported across the intestinal mucosa. Once across, the triglycerides are resynthesized and transported to the liver or adipose tissue. Fatty acids are oxidized through fatty acid or \u03b2-oxidation into two-carbon acetyl CoA molecules, which can then enter the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. If excess acetyl CoA is created and overloads the capacity of the Krebs cycle, the acetyl CoA can be used to synthesize ketone bodies. When glucose is limited, ketone bodies can be oxidized and used for fuel. Excess acetyl CoA generated from excess glucose or carbohydrate ingestion can be used for fatty acid synthesis or lipogenesis. Acetyl CoA is used to create lipids, triglycerides, steroid hormones, cholesterol, and bile salts. Lipolysis is the breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, making them easier for the body to process."}

{"prompt":"Question: In which phase do the sister chromatids separate?\nOptions:\n A. prophase\nB. passivation\nC. latent phase\nD. anaphase","completion":"anaphase\nExplanation: Anaphase is the phase in which the sister chromatids separate. The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the microtubules of the spindles, similar to the reeling in of a fish by the shortening of the fishing line. One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole. This process occurs when the proteins that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, resulting in unattached identical chromosomes, essentially separate daughter chromosomes. These separate chromosomes are pulled apart by shortening spindle fibers, and pulled toward the centrosomes to which they are attached. At the end of anaphase the spindle fibers degrade. At this time, each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes, identical to the amount of DNA at the beginning of G 1 of the cell cycle."}

{"prompt":"Question: What does the a1c test measure over the past two to three months?\nOptions:\n A. RBC levels\nB. cholesterol levels\nC. albumin levels\nD. blood-glucose levels","completion":"blood-glucose levels\nExplanation: Endocrinologist An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating endocrine disorders. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists include disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves\u2019 disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing\u2019s disease and Addison\u2019s disease). Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood-glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood-glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood-glucose levels over the past two to three months. The A1C test is an indicator of how well blood glucose is being managed over a long time. Once a disease such as diabetes has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin\u2019s production or effect. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections. In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections."}

{"prompt":"Question: A molecule has two structures that can be generated. what is this called?\nOptions:\n A. resonance hybrids\nB. congruence\nC. ethnocentrism\nD. isomerism","completion":"isomerism\nExplanation: The cis isomer has the two single hydrogen atoms on the same side of the molecule, while the trans isomer has them on opposite sides of the molecule. In both molecules, the bonding order of the atoms is the same. In order for geometric isomers to exist, there must be a rigid structure in the molecule to prevent free rotation around a bond. If the double bond in an alkene was capable of rotating, the two geometric isomers above would not exist. In addition, the two carbon atoms must each have two different groups attached in order for there to be geometric isomers. Propene has no geometric isomers because one of the carbon atoms has two single hydrogens bonded to it."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is used to measure blood pressure?\nOptions:\n A. anemometer\nB. spectrometer\nC. barometer\nD. sphygmomanometer","completion":"sphygmomanometer\nExplanation: Chemistry in Everyday Life Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer (Greek sphygmos = \u201cpulse\u201d). It consists of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow, a manometer to measure the pressure, and a method of determining when blood flow begins and when it becomes impeded (Figure 9.6). Since its invention in 1881, it has been an essential medical device. There are many types of sphygmomanometers: manual ones that require a stethoscope and are used by medical professionals; mercury ones, used when the most accuracy is required; less accurate mechanical ones; and digital ones that can be used with little training but that have limitations. When using a sphygmomanometer, the cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated until blood flow is completely blocked, then slowly released. As the heart beats, blood forced through the arteries causes a rise in pressure. This rise in pressure at which blood flow begins is the systolic pressure\u2014the peak pressure in the cardiac cycle. When the cuff\u2019s pressure equals the arterial systolic pressure, blood flows past the cuff, creating audible sounds that can be heard using a stethoscope. This is followed by a decrease in pressure as the heart\u2019s ventricles prepare for another beat. As cuff pressure continues to decrease, eventually sound is no longer heard; this is the diastolic pressure\u2014the lowest pressure (resting phase) in the cardiac cycle. Blood pressure units from a sphygmomanometer are in terms of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Many diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent the synthesis of critical what?\nOptions:\n A. proteins\nB. oils\nC. acids\nD. lipids","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Geneticist Many diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent the synthesis of critical proteins. One such disease is Lowe disease (also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys). In Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life, and may have impaired mental abilities. Lowe disease is a genetic disease caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two human sex chromosome, as these chromosomes determine a person's sex. Females possess two X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y chromosome. In females, the genes on only one of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Therefore, females who carry the Lowe disease gene on one of their X chromosomes have a 50\/50 chance of having the disease. However, males only have one X chromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have Lowe disease if their X chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. The location of the mutated gene, as well as the locations of many other mutations that cause genetic diseases, has now been identified. Through prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic diseases. Geneticists analyze the results of prenatal genetic tests and may counsel pregnant women on available options. They may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform DNA analyses that are used in forensic investigations."}
{"prompt":"Question: The creation of a voltage across a current-carrying conductor by a magnetic field is known as what?\nOptions:\n A. hall effect\nB. off effect\nC. newton effect\nD. show effect","completion":"hall effect\nExplanation: 22.6 The Hall Effect We have seen effects of a magnetic field on free-moving charges. The magnetic field also affects charges moving in a conductor. One result is the Hall effect, which has important implications and applications. Figure 22.27 shows what happens to charges moving through a conductor in a magnetic field. The field is perpendicular to the electron drift velocity and to the width of the conductor. Note that conventional current is to the right in both parts of the figure. In part (a), electrons carry the current and move to the left. In part (b), positive charges carry the current and move to the right. Moving electrons feel a magnetic force toward one side of the conductor, leaving a net positive charge on the other side. This separation of charge creates a voltage \u03b5 , known as the Hall emf, across the conductor. The creation of a voltage across a current-carrying conductor by a magnetic field is known as the Hall effect, after Edwin Hall, the American physicist who discovered it in 1879."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do muscles need to contract?\nOptions:\n A. stress\nB. stimulus\nC. tendons\nD. pressures","completion":"stimulus\nExplanation: Muscles cannot contract on their own. They need a stimulus from a nerve cell to \u201ctell\u201d them to contract. Let\u2019s say you decide to raise your hand in class.

As the genes that encode these traits are passed to the next generation, the traits will become more common in the population."}
{"prompt":"Question: What gas produced by fossil fuel use is a major cause of global warming?\nOptions:\n A. helium\nB. hydrogen\nC. carbon dioxide\nD. phosphorous","completion":"carbon dioxide\nExplanation: When fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel use is a major cause of global warming. The burning of fossil fuels also releases many pollutants into the air. Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals, stonework, and other materials. Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause smog, which is harmful to human health. Tiny particles, or particulates, released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health. Natural gas releases the least pollution; coal releases the most (see Figure below ). Petroleum has the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage ecosystems."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the more common term for ethanoic acid, the active substance in vinegar?\nOptions:\n A. methyl acid\nB. amino acid\nC. acetic acid\nD. polymer acid","completion":"acetic acid\nExplanation: Methanoic acid and ethanoic acid are also called formic acid and acetic acid, respectively. Formic acid is the compound that makes certain ant bites sting, while acetic acid is the active substance in vinegar. How acidic are carboxylic acids? It turns out that they are not very acidic. No carboxylic acid is on the list of strong acids (Table 12.2 \"Strong Acids and Bases\"). (For more information about strong acids, see Chapter 12 \"Acids and Bases\", Section 12.4 \"Strong and Weak Acids and Bases and Their Salts\". ) This means that all carboxylic acids are weak acids. A 1 M solution of formic acid is only about 1.3% dissociated into H+ ions and formate ions, while a similar solution of acetic acid is ionized by about only 0.4%. Some carboxylic acids are stronger\u2014for example, trichloroacetic acid is about 45% dissociated in aqueous solution. But no carboxylic acid approaches the 100% dissociation amount required by the definition of a strong acid. As their name suggests, however, carboxylic acids do act like acids in the presence of bases. The H atom in the carboxyl group comes off as the H+ ion, leaving acarboxylate anion:."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are ionic substances completely held together by?\nOptions:\n A. ionic bonds\nB. thermal bonds\nC. localized bonds\nD. magnetic bonds","completion":"ionic bonds\nExplanation: Ionic substances are completely held together by ionic bonds. The full charges of the ions (for example, Na + and Cl - in sodium chloride) cause electrostatic interactions that result in a stable crystal lattice. We saw in the previous chapter that most ionic compounds have high melting points, are brittle, are often soluble in water, and conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water. Ionic compounds exist as extended, orderly arrangements of ions. As we will see, this is quite different from the structure of molecular substances, which take the form of collections of individual molecules. The atoms within a molecule are held very strongly together, but the interactions between different molecules are significantly weaker."}

{"prompt":"Question: When resources become limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve in which the size will level off at a point called what?\nOptions:\n A. believed capacity\nB. full capacity\nC. carrying capacity\nD. containing capacity","completion":"carrying capacity\nExplanation: 19.2 Population Growth and Regulation Populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially\u2014with an accelerating growth rate. When resources become limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve in which population size will level off at the carrying capacity. Populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Life-history characteristics, such as age at first reproduction or numbers of offspring, are characteristics that evolve in populations just as anatomy or behavior can evolve over time. The model of r- and K-selection suggests that characters, and possibly suites of characters, may evolve adaptations to population stability near the carrying capacity (K-selection) or rapid population growth and collapse (r-selection). Species will exhibit adaptations somewhere on a continuum between these two extremes."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body?\nOptions:\n A. carotid\nB. capillary\nC. diastolic\nD. aorta","completion":"aorta\nExplanation: The Heart The heart is a complex muscle that consists of two pumps: one that pumps blood through pulmonary circulation to the lungs, and the other that pumps blood through systemic circulation to the rest of the body\u2019s tissues (and the heart itself). The heart is asymmetrical, with the left side being larger than the right side, correlating with the different sizes of the pulmonary and systemic circuits (Figure 16.10). In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation through the major veins: the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the head and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as the inferior vena cava, which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, which prevents the backflow of blood. After it is filled, the right ventricle contracts, pumping the blood to the lungs for reoxygenation. The left atrium receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped into the aorta. The aorta is the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals. (Figure 16.10)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which cycle is named after the scientist melvin calvin?\nOptions:\n A. krebs cycle\nB. melvin cycle\nC. calvin cycle\nD. melcal cycle","completion":"calvin cycle\nExplanation: The second stage of photosynthesis takes place in the stroma surrounding the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The reactions of this stage can occur without light, so they are sometimes called light-independent or dark reactions. This stage of photosynthesis is also known as the Calvin cycle because its reactions were discovered by a scientist named Melvin Calvin. He won a Nobel Prize in 1961 for this important discovery."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where are sperm produced in the process of spermatogenesis?\nOptions:\n A. penis\nB. intestines\nC. testes\nD. ovaries","completion":"testes\nExplanation: Sperm are produced in the testes in the process of spermatogenesis. They mature in the epididymes before being ejaculated from the body through the penis."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the basic unit of an organism called?\nOptions:\n A. cell\nB. electron\nC. singularity\nD. particle","completion":"cell\nExplanation: While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can perform a job together. These cells are called specialized because they have a special job. Specialized cells can be organized into tissues . For example, your liver cells are organized into liver tissue. Your liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver. Organs are formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to perform a job. All organs, from your heart to your liver, are made up of an organized group of tissues."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the two major atmospheric gases?\nOptions:\n A. nitrogen and oxygen\nB. carbon and helium\nC. nitrogen and hydrogen\nD. hydrogen and oxygen","completion":"nitrogen and oxygen\nExplanation: The major atmospheric gases are nitrogen and oxygen.

This result is interesting because of its simplicity. The only things that affect the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely independent of other factors, such as mass. As with simple harmonic oscillators, the period T for a pendulum is nearly independent of amplitude, especially if \u03b8 is less than about."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of water are cattails adapted for with narrow, strap-like leaves?\nOptions:\n A. stagnant water\nB. saline water\nC. turbulent water\nD. moving water","completion":"moving water\nExplanation: Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isn\u2019t feasible under water, so aquatic plants may have adaptations that help them keep their flowers above water. For instance, water lilies have bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. This allows the lilies to collect the maximum amount of sunlight, which does not penetrate very deeply below the water's surface. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams and rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, cattails have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to the moving water (see Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which blood cells serve to defend the body in various ways?\nOptions:\n A. helper blood cells\nB. white blood cells\nC. blue blood cells\nD. red blood cells","completion":"white blood cells\nExplanation: White blood cells are larger than red blood cells, but there are far fewer of them. Their role is to defend the body in various ways. For example, white blood cells called phagocytes engulf and destroy microorganisms and debris in the blood."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do stored fats provide our body with for later use?\nOptions:\n A. energy\nB. metals\nC. hydrogen\nD. water","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Fats are one type of lipid. Stored fat gives your body energy to use for later. It\u2019s like having money in a savings account: it\u2019s there in case you need it. Stored fat also cushions and protects internal organs. In addition, it insulates the body. It helps keep you warm in cold weather."}
{"prompt":"Question: Fitness and natural selection are parts of what theory that might describe how organisms change over time?\nOptions:\n A. evolution\nB. dessication\nC. gravity\nD. implementation","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals\u2019 fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection."}
{"prompt":"Question: One of the five fundamental conservation laws in the universe refers to conservation of what, which is the product of mass and velocity?\nOptions:\n A. momentum\nB. fluid\nC. energy\nD. light","completion":"momentum\nExplanation: The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe balances out \u2026 always. This law only makes sense if we measure \u201cmotion\u201d in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called momentum , can be exchanged from one object to another in a collision. The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision. Conservation of momentum is one of the five fundamental conservation laws in the universe. The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge conservation and CPT conservation."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is defined as a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits?\nOptions:\n A. co-operative\nB. endosymbiosis\nC. parasitic\nD. symbiosis","completion":"symbiosis\nExplanation: Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. The other organism may also benefit, it may be unaffected by the relationship, or it may be harmed by the relationship. Figure below shows an example of symbiosis. The birds in the picture are able to pick out food from the fur of the deer. The deer won't eat the birds. In fact, the deer knowingly lets the birds rest on it. What, if anything, do you think the deer gets out of the relationship?."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do mammals conserve heat with?\nOptions:\n A. fur or muscle\nB. skin or bones\nC. tendons or hair\nD. hair or fur","completion":"hair or fur\nExplanation: Mammals conserve heat with their hair or fur. It works like the layer of insulation in the walls of a house. It traps warm air next to the skin so it can\u2019t escape into the environment. Like the squirrel in Figure below , most mammals can make their hair or fur stand up from the skin. This makes it a better insulator. Mammals also have a layer of insulating fat beneath their skin. Other vertebrates lack this layer of fat."}

{"prompt":"Question: What force increases a slide downhill and decreases a slide uphill?\nOptions:\n A. nuclear\nB. frictional\nC. gravity\nD. tension","completion":"gravity\nExplanation: Discussion As might have been expected, the player slides a shorter distance by sliding uphill. Note that the problem could also have been solved in terms of the forces directly and the work energy theorem, instead of using the potential energy. This method would have required combining the normal force and force of gravity vectors, which no longer cancel each other because they point in different directions, and friction, to find the net force. You could then use the net force and the net work to find the distance d that reduces the kinetic energy to zero. By applying conservation of energy and using the potential energy instead, we need only consider the gravitational potential energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the type of mining called when materials are removed along a strip?\nOptions:\n A. surface mining\nB. edge mining\nC. strip mining\nD. pit mining","completion":"strip mining\nExplanation: Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging.

{"prompt":"Question: The cell walls of fungi are made of what?\nOptions:\n A. chitin\nB. lectin\nC. mucous\nD. cartilage","completion":"chitin\nExplanation: Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have unique physical, chemical, and genetic traits that set them apart from plants (and other eukaryotes). For example, the cell walls of fungi are made of chitin, not cellulose. Also, fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms, whereas plants make their own food. These are just a few of the reasons fungi are now placed in their own kingdom."}

Some of the most common protein functions are listed below:."}
{"prompt":"Question: The electronegativity of an element increases with increasing of what state?\nOptions:\n A. isolation\nB. evaporation\nC. conduction\nD. oxidation","completion":"oxidation\nExplanation: Oxides As with the halides, the nature of bonding in oxides of the transition elements is determined by the oxidation state of the metal. Oxides with low oxidation states tend to be more ionic, whereas those with higher oxidation states are more covalent. These variations in bonding are because the electronegativities of the elements are not fixed values. The electronegativity of an element increases with increasing oxidation state. Transition metals in low oxidation states have lower electronegativity values than oxygen; therefore, these metal oxides are ionic. Transition metals in very high oxidation states have electronegativity values close to that of oxygen, which leads to these oxides being covalent. The oxides of the first transition series can be prepared by heating the metals in air. These oxides are Sc2O3, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, Co3O4, NiO, and CuO. Alternatively, these oxides and other oxides (with the metals in different oxidation states) can be produced by heating the corresponding hydroxides, carbonates, or oxalates in an inert atmosphere. Iron(II) oxide can be prepared by heating iron(II) oxalate, and cobalt(II) oxide is produced by heating cobalt(II) hydroxide:."}

{"prompt":"Question: The enzymes that participate in fatty acid catabolism are located in what?\nOptions:\n A. carbohydrates\nB. mitochondria\nC. atoms\nD. nucleus","completion":"mitochondria\nExplanation: Like glucose, the fatty acids released in the digestion of triglycerides and other lipids are broken down in a series of sequential reactions accompanied by the gradual release of usable energy. Some of these reactions are oxidative and require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The enzymes that participate in fatty acid catabolism are located in the mitochondria, along with the enzymes of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. This localization of enzymes in the mitochondria is of the utmost importance because it facilitates efficient utilization of energy stored in fatty acids and other molecules. Fatty acid oxidation is initiated on the outer mitochondrial membrane. There the fatty acids, which like carbohydrates are relatively inert, must first be activated by conversion to an energy-rich fatty acid derivative of coenzyme A called fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA). The activation is catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. For each molecule of fatty acid activated, one molecule of coenzyme A and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}
{"prompt":"Question: What common code do all known living organisms use?\nOptions:\n A. biochemical\nB. Morse code\nC. code of ethics\nD. genetic","completion":"genetic\nExplanation: The genetic code is universal. All known living organisms use the same genetic code. This shows that all organisms share a common evolutionary history."}
{"prompt":"Question: Ectotherms undergo a variety of changes at the cellular level to acclimatize to shifts in what?\nOptions:\n A. density\nB. volume\nC. temperature\nD. altitude","completion":"temperature\nExplanation: There are 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes in the human genome, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Sex chromosomes specify an organism's genetic sex. Humans can have two different sex chromosomes, one called X and the other Y. Normal females possess two X chromosomes and normal males one X and one Y. An autosome is any chromosome other than a sex chromosome. The Figure below shows a representation of the 24 different human chromosomes. Figure below shows a karyotype of the human genome. A karyotype depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities. Karyotypes use chromosomes from the metaphase stage of mitosis."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is produced when an egg is fertilized by a sperm in a fallopian tube?\nOptions:\n A. uterus\nB. fetus\nC. zygote\nD. ovaries","completion":"zygote\nExplanation: Fertilization of an egg by a sperm in a fallopian tube produces a zygote. The zygote develops into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterus. The offspring then goes through the embryonic and fetal stages. The placenta supports the needs of the developing embryo and fetus. Birth generally occurs at about 38 months after fertilization."}
{"prompt":"Question: An object undergoing circular motion experiences centripetal what?\nOptions:\n A. velocity\nB. acceleration\nC. vibration\nD. transmission","completion":"acceleration\nExplanation: Linear or tangential acceleration refers to changes in the magnitude of velocity but not its direction. We know from Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation that in circular motion centripetal acceleration, a c , refers to changes in the direction of the velocity but not its magnitude. An object undergoing circular motion experiences centripetal acceleration, as seen in Figure 10.5. Thus, a t and a c are perpendicular and independent of one another. Tangential acceleration a t is directly related to the angular acceleration."}
{"prompt":"Question: As lava cools, tiny iron-rich crystals line up with earth\u2019s what?\nOptions:\n A. magnetic field\nB. gravitational field\nC. oceans\nD. molecular field","completion":"magnetic field\nExplanation: Some rocks contain little compasses too! As lava cools, tiny iron-rich crystals line up with Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Anywhere lavas have cooled, these magnetite crystals point to the magnetic poles. The little magnets point to where the north pole was when the lava cooled. Scientists can use this to figure out where the continents were at that time. This evidence clearly shows that the continents have moved."}
{"prompt":"Question: If you find dna floating in a cell's cytoplasm, what kind of organism is it?\nOptions:\n A. unicellular\nB. xerophytic\nC. prokaryotic\nD. eurocratic","completion":"prokaryotic\nExplanation: Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners. Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level. Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell\u2019s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.2). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors ( epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made ( post-translational level)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an unstable ratio of what?\nOptions:\n A. electrons to neutrons\nB. atoms to neutrons\nC. protons to neutrons\nD. nucleus to neutrons","completion":"protons to neutrons\nExplanation: Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. When the nucleus emits a particle, it gains or loses one or two protons, so the atom becomes a different element. Gamma decay, in contrast, occurs when a nucleus is in an excited state and has too much energy to be stable. This often happens after alpha or beta decay has occurred. Because only energy is emitted during gamma decay, the number of protons remains the same. Therefore, an atom does not become a different element during this type of decay."}
{"prompt":"Question: Evolutionary adaptation is evidenced by different shapes of what structures in birds with different food preferences?\nOptions:\n A. claws\nB. Stomach\nC. beaks\nD. necks","completion":"beaks\nExplanation: Notice the differences in the species\u2019 beaks in Figure 18.13. Evolution in response to natural selection based on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The seed-eating bird has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin\u2019s finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago."}
{"prompt":"Question: What process provides over 99% of the energy supply for life on earth?\nOptions:\n A. gases\nB. photosynthesis\nC. nutrients\nD. Carbon","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Photosynthesis provides over 99% of the energy supply for life on Earth. A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis , and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure below . Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or \u201cblack smokers. \u201d There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth\u2019s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food."}
{"prompt":"Question: Autoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in this?\nOptions:\n A. inheritance\nB. resistance\nC. molecular mimicry\nD. spontaneous mutation","completion":"molecular mimicry\nExplanation: Autoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry. Antibodies and TCRs may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised. As an example, infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of S. pyogenes. These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory TH1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Patients with this autoimmunity must be injected with insulin that originates from other sources."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell?\nOptions:\n A. epidermis\nB. cortex\nC. nucleus\nD. apoptosis","completion":"nucleus\nExplanation: The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell and contains most of the cell\u2019s DNA. Other organelles in eukaryotic cells include the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, and centrioles (in animal cells only). Each type of organelle has important functions in the cell."}
{"prompt":"Question: If a human only has 45 chromosomes it is most likely due to a mistake during what?\nOptions:\n A. meiosis\nB. testis\nC. mitosis\nD. plexus","completion":"meiosis\nExplanation: So far we have focused on traits due to one gene or several genes. But what about many genes? 100s or 1000s of genes? What would happen if an entire chromosome were missing or duplicated? What if a human had only 45 chromosomes? Or 47? This real possibility is usually due to mistakes during meiosis; the chromosomes do not fully separate from each other during sperm or egg formation. Specifically, nondisjunction is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during anaphase II. If a zygote forms from a gamete lacking a chromosome, a viable embryo cannot be produced. Most human abnormal chromosome numbers result in the death of the developing embryo, often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant. Occasionally, a zygote with an extra chromosome can become a viable embryo and develop."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where do lancelets live?\nOptions:\n A. on land\nB. shallow ocean water\nC. riverbeds\nD. deep sea caves","completion":"shallow ocean water\nExplanation: There are only about 25 living species of lancelets. They inhabit the ocean floor where the water is shallow. Lancelet larvae are free-swimming. The adults can swim but spend most of their time buried in the sand. Like tunicates, lancelets are filter feeders. They take in water through their mouth and expel it through an opening called the atriopore (see Figure below ). Lancelets reproduce sexually and have separates sexes."}

{"prompt":"Question: Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of what interaction between reactant particles?\nOptions:\n A. electric\nB. collisions\nC. explosions\nD. waves","completion":"collisions\nExplanation: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which system of the body is responsible for bringing air into the body?\nOptions:\n A. vascular system\nB. excretory system\nC. digestive system\nD. respiratory system","completion":"respiratory system\nExplanation: We breathe because we need oxygen. Breathing also releases carbon dioxide from our bodies into the air. The respiratory system is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Recall that oxygen is needed to make ATP."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the elongated bony structure that anchors the anterior thoracic cage?\nOptions:\n A. pelvis\nB. sternum\nC. collar bone\nD. tibia","completion":"sternum\nExplanation: Sternum The sternum is the elongated bony structure that anchors the anterior thoracic cage. It consists of three parts: the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The manubrium is the wider, superior portion of the sternum. The top of the manubrium has a shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular (suprasternal) notch. This can be easily felt at the anterior base of the neck, between the medial ends of the clavicles. The clavicular notch is the shallow depression located on either side at the superior-lateral margins of the manubrium. This is the site of the sternoclavicular joint, between the sternum and clavicle. The first ribs also attach to the manubrium. The elongated, central portion of the sternum is the body. The manubrium and body join together at the sternal angle, so called because the junction between these two components is not flat, but forms a slight bend. The second rib attaches to the sternum at the sternal angle. Since the first rib is hidden behind the clavicle, the second rib is the highest rib that can be identified by palpation. Thus, the sternal angle and second rib are important landmarks for the identification and counting of the lower ribs. Ribs 3\u20137 attach to the sternal body. The inferior tip of the sternum is the xiphoid process. This small structure is cartilaginous early in life, but gradually becomes ossified starting during middle age."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do chemotrophs extract energy from?\nOptions:\n A. liquid compounds\nB. carbon compounds\nC. fatty compounds\nD. chemical compounds","completion":"chemical compounds\nExplanation: A living cell is a system that is not in equilibrium with its surroundings; it requires a constant input of energy to maintain its nonequilibrium state. Cells maintain a low-entropy state by increasing the entropy of their surroundings. Aerobic organisms cannot survive in the absence of O2, whereas anaerobic organisms can live only in the absence of O2. Green plants and algae are phototrophs, which extract energy from the environment through a process called photosynthesis, the photochemical reduction of CO2 to a reduced carbon compound. Other species, called chemotrophs, extract energy from chemical compounds. One of the main processes chemotrophs use to obtain energy is respiration, which is the reverse of photosynthesis. Alternatively, some chemotrophs obtain energy byfermentation, in which an organic compound is both the oxidant and the reductant. Intermediates used by organisms to shuttle electrons between the reductant and the oxidant include NAD+ and NADH. Energy from the oxidation of nutrients is made available to cells through the synthesis of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Its energy is used by cells to synthesize substances through coupled reactions and to perform work. The body stores energy as sugars, protein, or fats before using it to produce ATP."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are negative electrons attracted to?\nOptions:\n A. positive protons\nB. hormones\nC. ions\nD. neutral electrons","completion":"positive protons\nExplanation: Negative electrons are attracted to positive protons, and this electric force keeps electrons moving about the nucleus. The force of attraction between protons and neutrons, called the strong force, holds the nucleus together."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of competition often leads to extinction because the species that is less well adapted gets fewer of the resources that both species need?\nOptions:\n A. intraspecific competition\nB. interspecific competition\nC. parasitism\nD. mutualism","completion":"interspecific competition\nExplanation: Interspecific competition often leads to extinction. The species that is less well adapted may get fewer of the resources that both species need. As a result, members of that species are less likely to survive, and the species may go extinct."}

{"prompt":"Question: Chemical reactions are typically written to imply that they proceed in one direction - if they can occur in either direction, they are considered what?\nOptions:\n A. singular\nB. observable\nC. reactive\nD. reversible","completion":"reversible\nExplanation: A chemical reaction is usually written in a way that suggests it proceeds in one direction, the direction in which we read, but all chemical reactions are reversible, and both the forward and reverse reaction occur to one degree or another depending on conditions. In a chemical equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, and the concentrations of products and reactants remain constant. If we run a reaction in a closed system so that the products cannot escape, we often find the reaction does not give a 100% yield of products. Instead, some reactants remain after the concentrations stop changing. At this point, when there is no further change in concentrations of reactants and products, we say the reaction is at equilibrium. A mixture of reactants and products is found at equilibrium. For example, when we place a sample of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4, a colorless gas) in a glass tube, it forms nitrogen dioxide (NO2, a brown gas) by the reaction N 2 O 4(g) \u21cc 2NO 2(g) The color becomes darker as N2O4 is converted to NO2. When the system reaches equilibrium, both N2O4 and NO2 are present (Figure 13.2)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name for the stratospheric gas layer that protects living things from uv radiation?\nOptions:\n A. carbon layer\nB. atmospheric layer\nC. ozone layer\nD. toposphere","completion":"ozone layer\nExplanation: The stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas.

{"prompt":"Question: When can mutations occur in genes?\nOptions:\n A. after rna replication\nB. after dna replication\nC. during rna replication\nD. during dna replication","completion":"during dna replication\nExplanation: The Evolution of Promoters The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene\u2019s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression. Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes. It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product [1] is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves. Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III In eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves."}

{"prompt":"Question: What occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a beta particle and energy?\nOptions:\n A. nucleus decay\nB. alpha decay\nC. beta decay\nD. methane decay","completion":"beta decay\nExplanation: Beta decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a beta particle and energy. A beta particle is an electron. It has a charge of -1. In nuclear equations, a beta particle is represented by the symbol . The subscript -1 represents the particle\u2019s charge, and the superscript 0 shows that the particle has virtually no mass. Nuclei contain only protons and neutrons, so how can a nucleus emit an electron? A neutron first breaks down into a proton and an electron (see Figure below ). Then the electron is emitted from the nucleus, while the proton stays inside the nucleus. The proton increases the atomic number by one, thus changing one element into another."}
{"prompt":"Question: A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called what?\nOptions:\n A. reach\nB. viscosity\nC. elasticity\nD. moisture","completion":"elasticity\nExplanation: The muscles all begin the actual process of contracting (shortening) when a protein called actin is pulled by a protein called myosin. This occurs in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac) after specific binding sites on the actin have been exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions (Ca++) and proteins (troponin and tropomyosin) that \u201cshield\u201d the actinbinding sites. Ca++ also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle, although its role is different: here Ca++ activates enzymes, which in turn activate myosin heads. All muscles require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to continue the process of contracting, and they all relax when the Ca++ is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded. A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called elasticity. It can recoil back to its original length due to elastic fibers. Muscle tissue also has the quality of extensibility; it can stretch or extend. Contractility allows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force. Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins\u2014actin and myosin. The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells (referred to as fibers) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, which creates a pattern, or stripes, called striations. The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification (see Figure 10.2). Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit (called a syncytium). Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle, the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber (which has only a single nucleus) has a uniform, nonstriated appearance (resulting in the name smooth muscle). However, the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient. Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system; and smooth muscle in the skin, visceral organs, and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body."}

{"prompt":"Question: What will happen if the gas particles inside an inflated balloon suddenly stop moving?\nOptions:\n A. balloon deflates\nB. balloon falls\nC. balloon bursts\nD. balloon inflates","completion":"balloon deflates\nExplanation: Gas molecules also exert pressure. Earth\u2019s atmosphere exerts pressure because gravity acts on the huge number of gas particles contained in the atmosphere, holding it in place. Pressure is also exerted by a small sample of gas, such as that which is contained in a balloon. Gas pressure is the pressure that results from collisions of gas particles with an object. Inside the balloon, the gas particles collide with the balloon\u2019s inner walls. It is those collisions which keep the balloon inflated. If the gas particles were to suddenly stop moving, the balloon would instantly deflate. The Figure below is an illustration of gas particles exerting pressure inside a container."}

{"prompt":"Question: Materials that can be magnetized are called?\nOptions:\n A. atoms materials\nB. iron materials\nC. ferromagnetic materials\nD. inclusions materials","completion":"ferromagnetic materials\nExplanation: In other materials, electrons fill the orbitals of the atoms that make up the material in a way to allow for each atom to have a tiny magnetic field, giving each atom a tiny north and south pole. There are large areas where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction. These areas are called magnetic domains . Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the material is still not magnetic. However, the material can be magnetized by placing it in a magnetic field. When this happens, all the magnetic domains become aligned, and the material becomes a magnet. This is illustrated in Figure below . Materials that can be magnetized are called ferromagnetic materials . They include iron, cobalt, and nickel."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the main artery of the systematic circulation called?\nOptions:\n A. femoral\nB. aorta\nC. subclavian\nD. carotid","completion":"aorta\nExplanation: Blood Vessels The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 16.12). Arteries take blood away from the heart. The main artery of the systemic circulation is the aorta; it branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. The aorta and arteries near the heart have heavy but elastic walls that respond to and smooth out the pressure differences caused by the beating heart. Arteries farther away from the heart have more muscle tissue in their walls that can constrict to affect flow rates of blood. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body. Arterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number, 10\u2019s to 100\u2019s of capillaries that branch among the cells of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit single red blood cells and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also leaks from the blood into the interstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds known as?\nOptions:\n A. volcano\nB. tornado\nC. tsunami\nD. hurricane","completion":"tornado\nExplanation: Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds.

The funnel moves along the ground, destroying everything in its path. As it moves it loses energy. Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles). Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide."}
{"prompt":"Question: Solutions can also become supersaturated , where the amount of solute dissolved exceeds what?\nOptions:\n A. its solubility\nB. part solubility\nC. its dissolution\nD. its concentration","completion":"its solubility\nExplanation: Solutions can also become supersaturated , where the amount of solute dissolved exceeds its solubility. Supersaturation most commonly occurs when a saturated solution is slowly cooled. They occur frequently in geological and meteorological processes. Supersaturated systems are unstable, and eventually, the solute will precipitate until a saturated solution is regenerated. We can quantify supersaturation by looking at solubility curves. If the ratio of solute to solvent is above the saturation curve at the given temperature, the solution is supersaturated. If it is on the curve, the solution is saturated, and if it is below the curve, the solution is unsaturated."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of blood vessels carry blood away from the heart?\nOptions:\n A. Heart\nB. tubes\nC. arteries\nD. Viens","completion":"arteries\nExplanation: Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.

{"prompt":"Question: The shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement of proteins in its what?\nOptions:\n A. enamel\nB. anode\nC. capsid\nD. nuclei","completion":"capsid\nExplanation: 22.1 Introduction Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However, they are not biological organisms so they are not classified in any kingdom of living things. They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid. Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are completely inert. Since first being identified in 1935, viruses have been classified into more than 160 major groups. Viruses are classified based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classified into 21 groups. Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacteriophages."}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of ph would you find in water from bogs?\nOptions:\n A. normal ph\nB. lower ph\nC. higher ph\nD. regular ph","completion":"lower ph\nExplanation: 44.4 Aquatic Biomes Aquatic ecosystems include both saltwater and freshwater biomes. The abiotic factors important for the structuring of aquatic ecosystems can be different than those seen in terrestrial systems. Sunlight is a driving force behind the structure of forests and also is an important factor in bodies of water, especially those that are very deep, because of the role of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms. Density and temperature shape the structure of aquatic systems. Oceans may be thought of as consisting of different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline and light penetrance. Different kinds of organisms are adapted to the conditions found in each zone. Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems that are home to a wide variety of species. Estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean; their shallow waters provide nourishment and shelter for young crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and many other species. Freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. Bogs are an interesting type of wetland characterized by standing water, lower pH, and a lack of nitrogen."}
{"prompt":"Question: Who proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything else?\nOptions:\n A. newton\nB. bell\nC. einstein\nD. wilson","completion":"newton\nExplanation: Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea. For example, in 1666, Isaac Newton introduced the idea that gravity is universal. People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are attracted by Earth. But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything else. This idea is known as Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation."}

{"prompt":"Question: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter from which part of the solid is exposed to other reactants?\nOptions:\n A. the surface\nB. the top\nC. the base\nD. the interior","completion":"the surface\nExplanation: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. For example, crushing a solid into a powder exposes more of the substance to other reactants. This may greatly speed up the reaction. You can see another example in Figure below . Iron rusts when it combines with oxygen in the air. The iron hammer head and iron nails will both rust eventually. Which will rust faster?."}
{"prompt":"Question: How long can carbon be stored in sedimentary rock?\nOptions:\n A. around 10,000 years\nB. less than 1000 years\nC. 22 weeks\nD. millions of years","completion":"millions of years\nExplanation: Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere. Cellular respiration releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Carbon is also released when organisms decompose. Human actions, such as the burning of fossil fuels, also release carbon into the atmosphere. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, release carbon from magma into the atmosphere. Warm ocean waters also release carbon, whereas cold ocean water dissolves carbon from the atmosphere. Photosynthesis (autotrophs) removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it to make organic compounds. Carbon cycles far more slowly through geological processes such as sedimentation. Runoff, rivers and streams dissolve carbon in rocks and carry it to the ocean. Sediments from dead organisms may form fossil fuels or carbon-containing rocks. Carbon may be stored in sedimentary rock for millions of years."}
{"prompt":"Question: Fossil records support the idea that periods of little change may be interrupted by bursts of rapid change, an evolutionary model contrasted by what?\nOptions:\n A. elitism\nB. darwinian\nC. minimalism\nD. gradualism","completion":"gradualism\nExplanation: When geologic and climatic conditions are changing, evolution may occur more quickly. Thus, long periods of little change may be interrupted by bursts of rapid change. This model of the timing of evolution is called punctuated equilibrium . It is better supported by the fossil record than is gradualism."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem?\nOptions:\n A. water cycle\nB. food pyramid\nC. fuel chain\nD. food chain","completion":"food chain\nExplanation: A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem. You can see an example of a food chain in Figure below . Producers form the base of all food chains. The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers. The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers. This chain can continue to multiple levels."}
{"prompt":"Question: The lowest resonant frequency is called the what?\nOptions:\n A. lowest\nB. simplest\nC. fundamental\nD. basic","completion":"fundamental\nExplanation: Given that maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the tube, such as the one shown in Figure 17.28. Here the standing wave has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or L = (3 \/ 4)\u03bb\u2032 , so that \u03bb\u2032 = 4L \/ 3 . Continuing this process reveals a whole series of shorterwavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms for the resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental, and they are collectively called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second harmonic, and so on. Figure 17.29 shows the fundamental and the first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which ductless gland releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids?\nOptions:\n A. marrow gland\nB. endocrine gland\nC. pineal gland\nD. adrenal glands","completion":"endocrine gland\nExplanation: Glandular Epithelium A gland is a structure made up of one or more cells modified to synthesize and secrete chemical substances. Most glands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = \u201cinside\u201d), or an exocrine gland whose secretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = \u201coutside\u201d)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is contained in the cavity of a long bone's central shaft?\nOptions:\n A. marrow\nB. blood\nC. calcium\nD. cells","completion":"marrow\nExplanation: Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity. The rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow, which produces blood cells (Figure 38.17).

{"prompt":"Question: Plants can reproduce sexually and in which other way?\nOptions:\n A. spontaneously\nB. asexually\nC. genetically\nD. horizontally","completion":"asexually\nExplanation: The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex life cycle allows for great variation. A general plant life cycle is represented by the diagram in Figure below . From the figure, you can see that the diploid sporophyte has a structure called a sporangium (plural, sporangia) that undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores . A spore develops into a haploid gametophyte . The gametophyte has male or female reproductive organs that undergo mitosis to form haploid gametes (sperm or eggs). Fertilization of gametes produces a diploid zygote . The zygote grows and develops into a mature sporophyte, and the cycle repeats."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of map shows the elevation and features in an area?\nOptions:\n A. geographic\nB. topographic\nC. meteorological\nD. gradient","completion":"topographic\nExplanation: Relief , or terrain, includes all the landforms of a region.

{"prompt":"Question: The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and this?\nOptions:\n A. coronary sinusoids\nB. tissue sinusoids\nC. hepatic sinusoids\nD. blood sinusoids","completion":"hepatic sinusoids\nExplanation: Histology The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and hepatic sinusoids. A hepatocyte is the liver\u2019s main cell type, accounting for around 80 percent of the liver's volume. These cells play a role in a wide variety of secretory, metabolic, and endocrine functions. Plates of hepatocytes called hepatic laminae radiate outward from the portal vein in each hepatic lobule. Between adjacent hepatocytes, grooves in the cell membranes provide room for each bile canaliculus (plural = canaliculi). These small ducts accumulate the bile produced by hepatocytes. From here, bile flows first into bile ductules and then into bile ducts. The bile ducts unite to form the larger right and left hepatic ducts, which themselves merge and exit the liver as the common hepatic duct. This duct then joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder, forming the common bile duct through which bile flows into the small intestine. A hepatic sinusoid is an open, porous blood space formed by fenestrated capillaries from nutrient-rich hepatic portal veins and oxygen-rich hepatic arteries. Hepatocytes are tightly packed around the fenestrated endothelium of these spaces, giving them easy access to the blood. From their central position, hepatocytes process the nutrients, toxins, and waste materials carried by the blood. Materials such as bilirubin are processed and excreted into the bile canaliculi. Other materials including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are processed and secreted into the sinusoids or just stored in the cells until called upon. The hepatic sinusoids combine and send blood to a central vein. Blood then flows through a hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava. This means that blood and bile flow in opposite directions. The hepatic sinusoids also contain star-shaped reticuloendothelial cells (Kupffer cells), phagocytes that remove dead red and white blood cells, bacteria, and other foreign material that enter the sinusoids. The portal triad is a distinctive arrangement around the perimeter of hepatic lobules, consisting of three basic structures: a bile duct, a hepatic artery branch, and a hepatic portal vein branch."}

Many rulers have both types of units, one on each edge. The ruler pictured below has only SI units. It is shown here bigger than it really is so it\u2019s easier to see the small lines, which measure millimeters. The large lines and numbers stand for centimeters. Count the number of small lines from the left end of the ruler (0.0). You should count 10 lines because there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter."}
{"prompt":"Question: In humans, what is the first organ to form and become functional?\nOptions:\n A. brain\nB. liver\nC. pancreas\nD. heart","completion":"heart\nExplanation: 19.5 Development of the Heart The heart is the first organ to form and become functional, emphasizing the importance of transport of material to and from the developing infant. It originates about day 18 or 19 from the mesoderm and begins beating and pumping blood about day 21 or 22. It forms from the cardiogenic region near the head and is visible as a prominent heart bulge on the surface of the embryo. Originally, it consists of a pair of strands called cardiogenic cords that quickly form a hollow lumen and are referred to as endocardial tubes. These then fuse into a single heart tube and differentiate into the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus, starting about day 22. The primitive heart begins to form an S shape within the pericardium between days 23 and 28. The internal septa begin to form about day 28, separating the heart into the atria and ventricles, although the foramen ovale persists until shortly after birth. Between weeks five and eight, the atrioventricular valves form. The semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which is the lightest of the widely used structural metals?\nOptions:\n A. magnesium\nB. Metal\nC. calcium\nD. potassium","completion":"magnesium\nExplanation: low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals, the heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the case of the alkali metals, this is part of the emission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce shades of red, whereas barium produces a green color. Magnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases the reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate forms on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. ) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is why most magnesium production is for lightweight alloys. Magnesium (shown in Figure 18.6), calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and air. At room temperature, barium shows the most vigorous reaction. The products of the reaction with water are hydrogen and the metal hydroxide. The formation of hydrogen gas indicates that the heavier alkaline earth metals are better reducing agents (more easily oxidized) than is hydrogen. As expected, these metals react with both acids and nonmetals to form ionic compounds. Unlike most salts of the alkali metals, many of the common salts of the alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water because of the high lattice energies of these compounds, containing a divalent metal ion."}
{"prompt":"Question: The ozone layer protects the earth from what?\nOptions:\n A. pollution\nB. light waves\nC. uv radiation\nD. radio waves","completion":"uv radiation\nExplanation: Plants maintain the atmosphere.

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock but does not change its chemical composition?\nOptions:\n A. molecular weathering\nB. chemical reaction\nC. radiation\nD. mechanical weathering","completion":"mechanical weathering\nExplanation: The weathering of rocks and minerals can be mechanical or chemical. Mechanical weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock. Mechanical weathering does not change the chemical composition of that material. Chemical weathering changes the composition of a mineral or rock. Different types of weathering can alter the same material. Soil forms on top of rock. The type of soil that forms depends on the environment of the region. For example, warm and wet climates form different soils than cold and dry climates. A profile through the soil shows different horizons. Topsoil is the most important layer for crops. Water, ice, wind, and gravity create or modify landforms on Earth's surface. These agents can erode or deposit features that indicate their presence. Erosion by water and ice lowered and rounded the Appalachians. These old mountains no longer look like the Himalaya. Someday the Himalaya may look like the Appalachians do now."}
{"prompt":"Question: The result of what, in places like the amazon rainforest, is that food will be harder to produce, clean water will be harder to find, and development of new medicines will become slower?\nOptions:\n A. biodiversity loss\nB. environmnental loss\nC. pollution loss\nD. biological loss","completion":"biodiversity loss\nExplanation: percent of the Amazon rainforest was lost. Rates are higher in other tropical rainforests. What we are likely to notice on a day-to-day basis as a result of biodiversity loss is that food will be more difficult to produce, clean water will be more difficult to find, and the rate of development of new medicines will become slower, as we depend upon other species for much of these services. This increased loss of biodiversity is almost entirely a result of human activities as we destroy species\u2019 habitats, introduce disruptive species into ecosystems, hunt some species to extinction, continue to warm the planet with greenhouse gases, and influence nature in other ways. Slowing the loss of biodiversity is within our abilities if we make dramatic changes in our consumptive behavior and identify and protect the elements of our ecosystems that we depend on for our lives and welfare."}

Boyle\u2019s law is an example of a second type of mathematical problem we see in chemistry\u2014one based on a mathematical formula. Tactics for working with mathematical formulas are different from tactics for working with conversion factors. First, most of the questions you will have to answer using formulas are word-type questions, so the first step is to identify what quantities are known and assign them to variables. Second, in most formulas, some mathematical rearrangements (i. , algebra) must be performed to solve for an unknown variable. The rule is that to find the value of the unknown variable, you must mathematically isolate the unknown variable by itself and in the numerator of one side of the equation. Finally, units must be consistent. For example, in Boyle\u2019s law there are two pressure variables; they must have the same unit. There are also two volume variables; they also must have the same unit. In most cases, it won\u2019t matter what the unit is, but the unit must be the same on both sides of the equation."}

{"prompt":"Question: When a solvent with a gas dissolved in it is heated, the kinetic energy of both the solvent and solute _________?\nOptions:\n A. increases\nB. evaporates\nC. generates\nD. decreases","completion":"increases\nExplanation: Several substances \u2013 HCl, NH 3 , and SO 2 \u2013 have solubility that decreases as temperature increases. They are all gases at standard pressure. When a solvent with a gas dissolved in it is heated, the kinetic energy of both the solvent and solute increases. As the kinetic energy of the gaseous solute increases, its molecules have a greater tendency to escape the attraction of the solvent molecules and return to the gas phase. Therefore, the solubility of a gas decreases as the temperature increases."}
{"prompt":"Question: Both pathways that isolate a population reproductively in some form, allopatric and sympatric describe what, which means the creation of new species?\nOptions:\n A. speciation\nB. accumulation\nC. extinction\nD. bacterial","completion":"speciation\nExplanation: 18.2 Formation of New Species Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). Both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something must cause a breach in the reproductive barriers. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species."}

{"prompt":"Question: Birds belong to a group of diapsids called the what?\nOptions:\n A. archosaurs\nB. conifers\nC. mammals\nD. aviators","completion":"archosaurs\nExplanation: Evolution of Birds The evolutionary history of birds is still somewhat unclear. Due to the fragility of bird bones, they do not fossilize as well as other vertebrates. Birds are diapsids, meaning they have two fenestrations or openings in their skulls. Birds belong to a group of diapsids called the archosaurs, which also includes crocodiles and dinosaurs. It is commonly accepted that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Dinosaurs (including birds) are further subdivided into two groups, the Saurischia (\u201clizard like\u201d) and the Ornithischia (\u201cbird like\u201d). Despite the names of these groups, it was not the bird-like dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds. Rather, Saurischia diverged into two groups: One included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus. The second group, bipedal predators called theropods, includes birds. This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which system refers to the skin and its accessory structures?\nOptions:\n A. digestive system\nB. malpighian system\nC. integumentary system\nD. tomoxia system","completion":"integumentary system\nExplanation: What do you think when you look at your skin in the mirror? Do you think about covering it with makeup, adding a tattoo, or maybe a body piercing? Or do you think about the fact that the skin belongs to one of the body\u2019s most essential and dynamic systems: the integumentary system? The integumentary system refers to the skin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward appearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5 to 2 m2. In fact, the skin and accessory structures are the largest organ system in the human body. As such, the skin protects your inner organs and it is in need of daily care and protection to maintain its health. This chapter will introduce the structure and functions of the integumentary system, as well as some of the diseases, disorders, and injuries that can affect this system."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are ionic solutes?\nOptions:\n A. solvent\nB. electrolytes\nC. salts\nD. carbohydrates","completion":"electrolytes\nExplanation: Each substance can be classified as an ionic solute or a nonionic solute. Ionic solutes are electrolytes, and nonionic solutes are nonelectrolytes. Potassium chloride is an ionic compound; therefore, when it dissolves, its ions separate, making it an electrolyte. Fructose is a sugar similar to glucose. (In fact, it has the same molecular formula as glucose. ) Because it is a molecular compound, we expect it to be a nonelectrolyte. Isopropyl alcohol is an organic molecule containing the alcohol functional group. The bonding in the compound is all covalent, so when isopropyl alcohol dissolves, it separates into individual molecules but not ions. Thus, it is a nonelectrolyte. Magnesium hydroxide is an ionic compound, so when it dissolves it dissociates. Thus, magnesium hydroxide is an electrolyte."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is prosopagnosia?\nOptions:\n A. face blindness\nB. way blindness\nC. lack of memory\nD. time blindness","completion":"face blindness\nExplanation: Brain: Prosopagnosia The failures of sensory perception can be unusual and debilitating. A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an important social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The word comes from the Greek words prosopa, that means \u201cfaces,\u201d and agnosia, that means \u201cnot knowing. \u201d Some people may feel that they cannot recognize people easily by their faces. However, a person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the most recognizable people in their respective cultures. They would not recognize the face of a celebrity, an important historical figure, or even a family member like their mother. They may not even recognize their own face. Prosopagnosia can be caused by trauma to the brain, or it can be present from birth. The exact cause of proposagnosia and the reason that it happens to some people is unclear. A study of the brains of people born with the deficit found that a specific region of the brain, the anterior fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, is often underdeveloped. This region of the brain is concerned with the recognition of visual stimuli and its possible association with memories. Though the evidence is not yet definitive, this region is likely to be where facial recognition occurs. Though this can be a devastating condition, people who suffer from it can get by\u2014often by using other cues to recognize the people they see. Often, the sound of a person\u2019s voice, or the presence of unique cues such as distinct facial features (a mole, for example) or hair color can help the sufferer recognize a familiar person. In the video on prosopagnosia provided in this section, a woman is shown having trouble recognizing celebrities, family members, and herself. In some situations, she can use other cues to help her recognize faces."}

{"prompt":"Question: The anterior pituitary produces seven different what, each with a special function?\nOptions:\n A. neurotransmitters\nB. proteins\nC. enzymes\nD. hormones","completion":"hormones\nExplanation: Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus, down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system. The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the measure of a fluid's thickness?\nOptions:\n A. viscosity\nB. friction\nC. elasticity\nD. salinity","completion":"viscosity\nExplanation: Characteristics of Blood When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that has just taken up oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red. This is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation. Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid\u2019s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma proteins and formed elements within the blood. The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow. Consider the difference in flow between water and honey. The more viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow than the less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood. The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature\u2014about 38 \u00b0C (or 100.4 \u00b0F), compared to 37 \u00b0C (or 98.6 \u00b0F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 \u00b0C are normal.

{"prompt":"Question: Gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through what?\nOptions:\n A. diffusion\nB. vaporization\nC. secretion\nD. activation","completion":"diffusion\nExplanation: Basic Principles of Gas Exchange Gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood that is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. The air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide. This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration. Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. This concept is discussed further in detail below."}

Of course, beyond this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth. Example:sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population, community, eco systems."}
{"prompt":"Question: A warm-air heating system uses what kind of energy to heat air?\nOptions:\n A. atmospheric\nB. thermal\nC. nuclear\nD. cosmic","completion":"thermal\nExplanation: A warm-air heating system uses thermal energy to heat air. It then forces the warm air through a system of ducts. You can see a diagram of this type of heating system in Figure below . Typically, the air is heated in a furnace that burns natural gas or heating oil. When the air is warm, a fan blows it through the ducts and out through vents that are located in each room. Warm air blowing out of a vent moves across the room, pushing cold air out of the way. The cold air enters an intake vent on the opposite side of the room and returns to the furnace with the help of another fan. In the furnace, the cold air is heated, and the cycle repeats."}

{"prompt":"Question: Unlike free-living species of flatworms that are predators or scavengers, what forms feed from the tissues of their hosts?\nOptions:\n A. aquatic\nB. mutualistic\nC. parasitic\nD. herbiverous","completion":"parasitic\nExplanation: Flatworms The relationships among flatworms, or phylum Platyhelminthes, is being revised and the description here will follow the traditional groupings. Most flatworms are parasitic, including important parasites of humans. Flatworms have three embryonic germ layers that give rise to surfaces covering tissues, internal tissues, and the lining of the digestive system. The epidermal tissue is a single layer of cells or a layer of fused cells covering a layer of circular muscle above a layer of longitudinal muscle. The mesodermal tissues include support cells and secretory cells that secrete mucus and other materials to the surface. The flatworms are acoelomate, so their bodies contain no cavities or spaces between the outer surface and the inner digestive tract. Physiological Processes of Flatworms Free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers, whereas parasitic forms feed from the tissues of their hosts. Most flatworms have an incomplete digestive system with an opening, the \u201cmouth,\u201d that is also used to expel digestive."}

{"prompt":"Question: What electrical force is responsible for fission?\nOptions:\n A. momentum\nB. repulsion\nC. velocity\nD. friction","completion":"repulsion\nExplanation: The strong force predominates and can cause nuclei of complex atoms with many protons to be stable. The electric force of repulsion is responsible for fission, the breaking apart of nuclei, and therefore also for atom bombs and nuclear power. A form of fission where a helium nucleus is a product, is called alpha radiation. The actions of the weak force give rise to beta radiation. A change in nuclear energy can also give rise to gamma radiation , high energy electromagnetic waves. Particles that emit alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation go through the process of radioactive decay, which causes the heating of the molten core of the earth, and has even played a role in the mutations in our evolutionary history. Fission and fusion, the latter occurring when light nuclei combine to form new elements, are accompanied by copious amounts of gamma radiation. These processes often produce radioactive nuclei; in nature these radioactive nuclei were forged in the explosive deaths of ancient stars."}

{"prompt":"Question: What abbreviated form refers to oxidation-reduction reactions, which are part of respiration and photosynthesis?\nOptions:\n A. redox reactions\nB. oxid reactions\nC. morph reactions\nD. reflex reactions","completion":"redox reactions\nExplanation: In stoichiometry, quantities of reactants and\/or products can be related to each other using the balanced chemical equation. The coefficients in a balanced chemical reaction are used to devise the proper ratios that relate the number of molecules of one substance to the number of molecules of another substance. Chemical reactions can be classified by type. Combination reactions (also called composition reactions) make a substance from other substances. Decomposition reactions break one substance down into multiple substances. Combustion reactions combine molecular oxygen with the atoms of another reactant. Oxidation reactions are reactions in which an atom loses an electron. Reduction reactions are reactions in which an atom gains an electron. These two processes always occur together, so they are collectively referred to as oxidationreduction (or redox) reactions. The species being oxidized it called the reducing agent, while the species being reduced is the oxidizing agent. Alternate definitions of oxidation and reduction focus on the gain or loss of oxygen atoms, or the loss or gain of hydrogen atoms. Redox reactions are easily balanced if the overall reaction is first separated into half reactions, which are individually balanced. Oxidation-reduction reactions are common in organic and biological chemistry. Respiration, the process by which we inhale and metabolize oxygen, is a series of redox reactions. In the absence of oxygen, redox reactions still occur in a process called anaerobic metabolism. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid also play a part in the human diet, acting as reducing agents in various biochemical reactions. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert water and carbon dioxide to glucose, is also based on redox reactions."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the scientific term for farsightedness?\nOptions:\n A. hypoxia\nB. myopia\nC. hyperopia\nD. micropsia","completion":"hyperopia\nExplanation: Hyperopia is commonly called farsightedness.

{"prompt":"Question: Hurricanes that form in the tropics are called what?\nOptions:\n A. rain cyclones\nB. tornados\nC. caribbean cyclones\nD. tropical cyclones","completion":"tropical cyclones\nExplanation: Hurricanes are cyclones. Since they form in the tropics, they are called tropical cyclones. These storms form over very warm ocean water in summer and autumn. The temperature of the sea surface must be 28 o C (82 o F) or higher. The air above the water warms and rises. This forms a low pressure cell. The air begins to rotate around the low pressure cell. Water vapor condenses. If conditions are right, the storm will build into a hurricane in two to three days."}
{"prompt":"Question: Bacteria may divide several what an hour?\nOptions:\n A. cells\nB. times\nC. hosts\nD. days","completion":"times\nExplanation: Asexual reproduction can be very rapid. This is an advantage for many organisms. It allows these organisms to crowd out other organisms that reproduce more slowly. Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacterial cells in just a few hours. However, most bacteria do not live under ideal conditions. If they did, the entire surface of the planet would soon be covered with them. Instead, their reproduction is kept in check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes. This is true of most other organisms as well."}

{"prompt":"Question: Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through which gas?\nOptions:\n A. sulfide dioxide\nB. carbon dioxide\nC. sulfur dioxide\nD. essential dioxide","completion":"sulfur dioxide\nExplanation: Sulfur enters the ocean in runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. Some ecosystems rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates. Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain, which damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, thus killing many of the resident plants and animals. Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years. These examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future."}
{"prompt":"Question: Heat expansion is a result of the increase of what type of energy, exhibited by molecules bumping together?\nOptions:\n A. light energy\nB. radioactivity\nC. kinetic energy\nD. harmonic energy","completion":"kinetic energy\nExplanation: Heat expansion is a result of the increase of kinetic energy of the molecules.

Most steels also contain small but definite percentages of carbon (0.04%\u20132.5%). However, a large part of the carbon contained in iron must be removed in the manufacture of steel; otherwise, the excess carbon would make the iron brittle."}
{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen?\nOptions:\n A. guardian\nB. initial\nC. host\nD. parent","completion":"host\nExplanation: Introduction The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts. A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents. Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses."}
{"prompt":"Question: Most lipid hormones are derived from what?\nOptions:\n A. protein\nB. tissue\nC. fat\nD. cholesterol","completion":"cholesterol\nExplanation: Lipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones) Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in Figure 37.2. The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. Chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols; their chemical names will end in \u201c-ol\u201d for alcohols or \u201c-one\u201d for ketones. Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone, and testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone. These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively. Other steroid hormones include aldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. Steroid hormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. As a result, they remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones. For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the first step towards wound repair?\nOptions:\n A. electrolysis factors\nB. clotting factors\nC. hormone factors\nD. blotting factors","completion":"clotting factors\nExplanation: attracted to the sites of infections in large numbers, and as they phagocytose the pathogens and subsequently die, their accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection site. Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons. Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the increase in vascular permeability encourages the entry of clotting factors, the first step towards wound repair. Inflammation also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune response."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for an expression showing the relationship of the reaction rate to the concentrations of each reactant?\nOptions:\n A. rate law\nB. decay law\nC. flow law\nD. concentric law","completion":"rate law\nExplanation: The proportionality between the rate and becomes an equal sign by the insertion of a constant . A rate law is an expression showing the relationship of the reaction rate to the concentrations of each reactant. The specific rate constant is the proportionality constant relating the rate of the reaction to the concentrations of reactants. The rate law and the specific rate constant for any chemical reaction must be determined experimentally. The value of the rate constant is temperature dependent. A large value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively fast, while a small value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively slow."}
{"prompt":"Question: Also called lodestone, the mineral magnetite is the most powerful what?\nOptions:\n A. material on Earth\nB. natural permanent magnet\nC. synthetic magnet\nD. healing magnet","completion":"natural permanent magnet\nExplanation: Some materials are natural permanent magnets. The most magnetic material in nature is the mineral magnetite, also called lodestone (see Figure below ). The magnetic domains of magnetite naturally align with Earth\u2019s axis. The picture on the left shows a chunk of magnetite attracting small bits of iron. The magnetite spoon compass shown on the right dates back about 2000 years and comes from China. The handle of the spoon always points north. Clearly, the magnetic properties of magnetite have been recognized for thousands of years."}
{"prompt":"Question: Do metals tend to gain electrons or lose electrons in chemical reactions?\nOptions:\n A. lose electrons\nB. develop electrons\nC. same number of electrons\nD. gain electrons","completion":"lose electrons\nExplanation: Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal. Metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, as indicated by their low ionization energies. Within a compound, metal atoms have relatively low attraction for electrons, as indicated by their low electronegativities. By following the trend summary in the figure below, you can see that the most reactive metals would reside in the lower left portion of the periodic table. The most reactive metal is cesium, which is not found in nature as a free element. It reacts explosively with water and will ignite spontaneously in air. Francium is below cesium in the alkali metal group, but is so rare that most of its properties have never been observed."}
{"prompt":"Question: Loss of energy is the reason that what typically has few levels?\nOptions:\n A. humans\nB. the atmosphere\nC. food chain\nD. video games","completion":"food chain\nExplanation: At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost. Only about ten percent of the energy passes to the next level. Where does that energy go? Some energy is given off as heat. Some energy goes into animal wastes. Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer can't eat, like fur. It's because so much energy is lost that most food chains have just a few levels. There\u2019s not enough energy left for higher levels."}
{"prompt":"Question: A lewis acid is a substance that accepts a pair of electrons to form what?\nOptions:\n A. accretion bond\nB. covalent bond\nC. functionality bond\nD. ambivalent bond","completion":"covalent bond\nExplanation: Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) proposed a third theory of acids and bases that is even more general than either the Arrhenius or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theories. A Lewis acid is a substance that accepts a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. A Lewis base is a substance that donates a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. So, a Lewis acid-base reaction is represented by the transfer of a pair of electrons from a base to an acid. A hydrogen ion, which lacks any electrons, accepts a pair of electrons. It is an acid under both the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions. Ammonia consists of a nitrogen atom as the central atom with a lone pair of electrons. The reaction between ammonia and the hydrogen ion can be depicted as shown in the Figure below ."}

{"prompt":"Question: Oxides of small, highly charged ions of what type tend to be acidic?\nOptions:\n A. metal\nB. liquid\nC. steel\nD. plastic","completion":"metal\nExplanation: Summary The transition metals are characterized by partially filled d subshells in the free elements and cations. The ns and (n \u2212 1)d subshells have similar energies, so small influences can produce electron configurations that do not conform to the general order in which the subshells are filled. In the secondand third-row transition metals, such irregularities can be difficult to predict, particularly for the third row, which has 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals that are very close in energy. The increase in atomic radius is greater between the 3d and 4d metals than between the 4d and 5d metals because of the lanthanide contraction. Ionization energies and electronegativities increase slowly across a row, as do densities and electrical and thermal conductivities, whereas enthalpies of hydration decrease. Anomalies can be explained by the increased stabilization of half-filled and filled subshells. Transition-metal cations are formed by the initial loss of ns electrons, and many metals can form cations in several oxidation states. Higher oxidation states become progressively less stable across a row and more stable down a column. Oxides of small, highly charged metal ions tend to be acidic, whereas oxides of metals with a low charge-to-radius ratio are basic."}

The part of the wave that is nearer the shore reaches shallow water sooner than the part that is farther out. The shallow part of the wave \"feels\" the bottom first. This slows down the inshore part of the wave and makes the wave \"bend. \" This bending is called refraction ."}
{"prompt":"Question: What nerves are connected to the spinal cord?\nOptions:\n A. spinal nerves\nB. primary nerves\nC. posterior nerves\nD. superior nerves","completion":"spinal nerves\nExplanation: Spinal Nerves The nerves connected to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than that of the cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor axons that separate into two nerve roots. The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both somatic and autonomic, emerge as the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve. There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves designated L1 to L5, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves are numbered from the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its level. The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital bone. The second nerve, C2, emerges between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to C7, but C8 emerges between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that has the same designation and the next vertebra in the column. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the length of that unique vertebra. Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve. This occurs at four places along the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a nerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies."}

In the early 1900s, scientists started using seismographic data to learn about Earth\u2019s inner structure. A seismograph detects and measure earthquake waves. Evidence from earthquakes showed that Earth has a solid inner core and a liquid outer core (see the Figure below ). The outer core consists of molten metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earth\u2019s magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles through these molten metals in the outer core. The particles move as Earth spins on its axis.

This supergroup includes heterotrophic predators, photosynthetic species, and parasites. Its subgroups are the diplomonads, parabasalids, and euglenozoans. Diplomonads Among the Excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite, Giardia lamblia (Figure 23.10). Until recently, these protists were believed to lack mitochondria. Mitochondrial remnant organelles, called mitosomes, have since been identified in diplomonads, but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional. Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as glycolysis, to generate energy. Each diplomonad cell has two identical nuclei and uses several flagella for locomotion."}
{"prompt":"Question: Closely associated with \"work\", what is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved?\nOptions:\n A. heating\nB. fuel\nC. energy\nD. matter","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Introduction to Work, Energy, and Energy Resources Energy plays an essential role both in everyday events and in scientific phenomena. You can no doubt name many forms of energy, from that provided by our foods, to the energy we use to run our cars, to the sunlight that warms us on the beach. You can also cite examples of what people call energy that may not be scientific, such as someone having an energetic personality. Not only does energy have many interesting forms, it is involved in almost all phenomena, and is one of the most important concepts of physics. What makes it even more important is that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. Energy can change forms, but it cannot appear from nothing or disappear without a trace. Energy is thus one of a handful of physical quantities that we say is conserved. Conservation of energy (as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed) is based on experiment. Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy, conservation of energy has always been found to apply. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this was supplied by Einstein when he suggested that mass is equivalent to energy (his famous equation E = mc 2 ). From a societal viewpoint, energy is one of the major building blocks of modern civilization. Energy resources are key limiting factors to economic growth. The world use of energy resources, especially oil, continues to grow, with ominous consequences economically, socially, politically, and environmentally. We will briefly examine the world\u2019s energy use patterns at the end of this chapter. There is no simple, yet accurate, scientific definition for energy. Energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved. We can loosely define energy as the ability to do work, admitting that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work. Because of the association of energy with work, we begin the chapter with a discussion of work. Work is intimately related to energy and how energy moves from one system to another or changes form."}

{"prompt":"Question: The two parts of photosynthesis photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and which cycle?\nOptions:\n A. colors cycle\nB. klein cycle\nC. dark cycle\nD. calvin cycle","completion":"calvin cycle\nExplanation: The Two Parts of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as \u201cfull\u201d because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the \u201cempty\u201d energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which is the final step of cell division?\nOptions:\n A. genesys\nB. cytokinesis\nC. Mitosis\nD. electrolysis","completion":"cytokinesis\nExplanation: Cytokinesis is the final step in cell division. It often occurs concurrently with telophase, though it is a separate process. Cytokinesis ( Figure below ) differs between plant and animal cells. In animal cells, the plasma membrane pinches inward along the cell\u2019s equator until two cells are formed. Specifically, a cleavage furrow containing a contractile ring develops in approximately the middle of the cell (similar to the position of the metaphase plate), essentially pinching off the two nuclei and forming separate cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the cells equator. A new membrane grows along each side of the cell plate, with a new cell wall forming on the outside of each new membrane."}

{"prompt":"Question: The measure of magnetic fields is named after a serbian physicist. what is his name?\nOptions:\n A. Carl Sagan\nB. Albert Einstein\nC. nikola tesla\nD. Niels Bohr","completion":"nikola tesla\nExplanation: For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone. If charges are moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism. The century realization that electricity and magnetism are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our understanding of the world we live in. Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the understanding that moving charges \u2013 electric currents \u2013 create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric fields. Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will have current induced in it. This is called electromagnetic induction. Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla."}

Plants in the Arctic tundra have a short growing season of approximately 50\u201360 days. However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is low (15\u201325 cm or 6\u201310 in) with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation because of the cold temperatures. Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground and include low shrubs, grasses, lichens, and small flowering plants (Figure 20.26). There is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate far into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. The melting of the permafrost in the brief summer provides water for a burst of productivity while temperatures and long days permit it. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens."}

{"prompt":"Question: Transport of water and solutes in plants water potential is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and this?\nOptions:\n A. green water\nB. dirty water\nC. pure water\nD. salty water","completion":"pure water\nExplanation: 30.5 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants Water potential (\u03a8) is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and pure water. The water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and matric potential. Water potential and transpiration influence how water is transported through the xylem in plants. These processes are regulated by stomatal opening and closing. Photosynthates (mainly sucrose) move from sources to sinks through the plant\u2019s phloem. Sucrose is actively loaded into the sieve-tube elements of the phloem. The increased solute concentration causes water to move by osmosis from the xylem into the phloem. The positive pressure that is produced pushes water and solutes down the pressure gradient. The sucrose is unloaded into the sink, and the water returns to the xylem vessels."}

For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21. On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun. This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is pointed away from the Sun. This means that the Southern Hemisphere experiences its longest night and shortest day ( Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference in voltage across a resistor or other electrical devices called?\nOptions:\n A. volt effect\nB. falling voltage\nC. power drop\nD. voltage drop","completion":"voltage drop\nExplanation: The name electric current is the name given to the phenomenon that occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of light. Voltage is the electrical energy density that causes the electric current. Resistance is the amount a device in the wire resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other forms of energy. A device, the resistor, could be a light bulb, transferring electrical energy into heat and light or an electric motor that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in Voltage across a resistor or other electrical device is called the voltage drop."}

{"prompt":"Question: Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their what?\nOptions:\n A. atomic number\nB. chemical structure\nC. chemical weight\nD. elemental type","completion":"chemical structure\nExplanation: During this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (Figure 3.14)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What law explains why some objects float and some sink.\nOptions:\n A. newton's law\nB. montenegrins ' law\nC. flanges ' law\nD. archimedes' law","completion":"archimedes' law\nExplanation: Archimedes\u2019 law explains why some objects float in fluids even though they are very heavy. It all depends on how much fluid they displace. The cruise ship pictured in the opening image is extremely heavy, yet it stays afloat. If a steel ball with the same weight as the ship were placed in water, it would sink to the bottom. This is modeled in the Figure below . The reason the ball sinks is that its shape is very compact, so it displaces relatively little water. The volume of water displaced by the steel ball weighs less than the ball itself, so the buoyant force is not as great as the force of gravity pulling down on the ball. Thus, the ball sinks."}
{"prompt":"Question: The core of a nuclear reactor generates a large amount of what type of energy from the decay of fission products, even when the power-producing fission chain reaction is turned off?\nOptions:\n A. evaporation\nB. thermal\nC. elastic\nD. erosion","completion":"thermal\nExplanation: Explain why the fission of heavy nuclei releases energy. Similarly, why is it that energy input is required to fission light nuclei? 19. Explain, in terms of conservation of momentum and energy, why collisions of neutrons with protons will thermalize neutrons better than collisions with oxygen. The ruins of the Chernobyl reactor are enclosed in a huge concrete structure built around it after the accident. Some rain penetrates the building in winter, and radioactivity from the building increases. What does this imply is happening inside? 21. Since the uranium or plutonium nucleus fissions into several fission fragments whose mass distribution covers a wide range of pieces, would you expect more residual radioactivity from fission than fusion? Explain. The core of a nuclear reactor generates a large amount of thermal energy from the decay of fission products, even when the power-producing fission chain reaction is turned off. Would this residual heat be greatest after the reactor has run for a long time or short time? What if the reactor has been shut down for months? 23. How can a nuclear reactor contain many critical masses and not go supercritical? What methods are used to control the fission in the reactor? 24. Why can heavy nuclei with odd numbers of neutrons be induced to fission with thermal neutrons, whereas those with even numbers of neutrons require more energy input to induce fission? 25.

{"prompt":"Question: Atomic orbitals are populated with what subatomic particles?\nOptions:\n A. electrons\nB. protons\nC. neurons\nD. atoms","completion":"electrons\nExplanation: A completely bonding molecular orbital contains no nodes (regions of zero electron probability) perpendicular to the internuclear axis, whereas a completelyantibonding molecular orbital contains at least one node perpendicular to the internuclear axis. A sigma (\u03c3) orbital (bonding) or a sigma star (\u03c3*) orbital(antibonding) is symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Hence all cross-sections perpendicular to that axis are circular. Both a pi (\u03c0) orbital (bonding) and a pi star (\u03c0*) orbital (antibonding) possess a nodal plane that contains the nuclei, with electron density localized on both sides of the plane. The energies of the molecular orbitals versus those of the parent atomic orbitals can be shown schematically in an energy-level diagram. The electron configuration of a molecule is shown by placing the correct number of electrons in the appropriate energy-level diagram, starting with the lowest-energy orbital and obeying the Pauli principle; that is, placing only two electrons with opposite spin in each orbital. From the completed energy-level diagram, we can calculate thebond order, defined as one-half the net number of bonding electrons. In bond orders, electrons in antibonding molecular orbitals cancel electrons in bonding molecular orbitals, while electrons in nonbonding orbitals have no effect and are not counted. Bond orders of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. Molecules with predicted bond orders of 0 are generally less stable than the isolated atoms and do not normally exist. Molecular orbital energy-level diagrams for diatomic molecules can be created if the electron configuration of the parent atoms is known, following a few simple rules. Most important, the number of molecular orbitals in a molecule is the same as the number of atomic orbitals that interact. The difference between bonding and antibonding molecular orbital combinations is proportional to the overlap of the parent orbitals and decreases as the energy difference between the parent atomic orbitals increases. With such an approach, the electronic structures of virtually all commonly encountered homonuclear diatomic molecules, molecules with two identical atoms, can be understood. The molecular orbital approach correctly predicts that the O2 molecule has two unpaired electrons and hence is attracted into a magnetic field. In contrast, most substances have only paired electrons. A similar procedure can be applied to molecules with two dissimilar atoms, calledheteronuclear diatomic molecules, using a molecular orbital energy-level diagram that is skewed or tilted toward the more electronegative element."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells?\nOptions:\n A. dna analysis\nB. rna analysis\nC. proteins analysis\nD. residues analysis","completion":"rna analysis\nExplanation: RNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA. Gel Electrophoresis Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.4). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel."}

{"prompt":"Question: The carrying angle is larger in females to accommodate their what?\nOptions:\n A. broader shoulders\nB. narrower pelvis\nC. cranium\nD. wider pelvis","completion":"wider pelvis\nExplanation: the ulna and radius bones. The small, rounded area that forms the distal end is the head of the ulna. Projecting from the posterior side of the ulnar head is the styloid process of the ulna, a short bony projection. This serves as an attachment point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the ulna and radius. In the anatomical position, with the elbow fully extended and the palms facing forward, the arm and forearm do not form a straight line. Instead, the forearm deviates laterally by 5\u201315 degrees from the line of the arm. This deviation is called the carrying angle. It allows the forearm and hand to swing freely or to carry an object without hitting the hip. The carrying angle is larger in females to accommodate their wider pelvis."}

{"prompt":"Question: What colorful arc-shaped atmospheric phenomena are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection?\nOptions:\n A. lightning\nB. shadows\nC. sunsets\nD. rainbows","completion":"rainbows\nExplanation: Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you look away from the sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown in Figure 25.24. The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Since the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed, and a rainbow is observed, as shown in Figure 25.25 (a). (There is no dispersion caused by reflection at the back surface, since the law of reflection does not depend on wavelength. ) The actual rainbow of colors seen by an observer depends on the myriad of rays being refracted and reflected toward the observer\u2019s eyes from numerous drops of water. The effect is most spectacular when the background is dark, as in stormy weather, but can also be observed in waterfalls and lawn sprinklers. The arc of a rainbow comes from the need to be looking at a specific angle relative to the direction of the sun, as illustrated in Figure 25.25 (b). (If there are two reflections of light within the water drop, another \u201csecondary\u201d rainbow is produced. This rare event produces an arc that lies above the primary rainbow arc\u2014see Figure 25.25 (c). ) Rainbows Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection."}

{"prompt":"Question: The measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension is its what?\nOptions:\n A. depth\nB. length\nC. stretch\nD. portion","completion":"length\nExplanation: Length is the measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension. The SI basic unit of length, or linear measure, is the meter (m). All measurements of length may be made in meters, though the prefixes listed in various tables will often be more convenient. The width of a room may be expressed as about 5 meters (m), whereas a large distance, such as the distance between New York City and Chicago, is better expressed as 1150 kilometers (km). Very small distances can be expressed in units such as the millimeter or the micrometer. The width of a typical human hair is about 20 micrometers (\u03bcm)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Bivalvia and gastropoda are classes of what phylum?\nOptions:\n A.

Mollusks have a radula for scraping food. Mollusks have ventral nerve cords. The tissue beneath the shell is called the mantle. The mantle cavity contains hemolymph. Mollusk Diversity This phylum is comprised of seven classes: Aplacophora, Monoplacophora, Polyplacophora, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, and Scaphopoda. Class Aplacophora (\u201cbearing no plates\u201d) includes worm-like animals living mostly on deep ocean bottoms. These animals lack a shell but have aragonite spicules on their skin. Members of class Monoplacophora (\u201cbearing one plate\u201d) have a single, cap-like shell enclosing the body. The monoplacophorans were believed extinct and only known as fossils until the discovery of Neopilina galatheae in 1952. Today, scientists have identified nearly two dozen living species. Animals in the class Polyplacophora (\u201cbearing many plates\u201d) are commonly known as \u201cchitons\u201d and bear an armor-like, eight-plated shell (Figure 15.25). These animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for attachment to rocks and a mantle that extends beyond the shell in the form of a girdle. They breathe with ctenidia (gills) present ventrally. These animals have a radula modified for scraping. A single pair of nephridia for excretion is present."}

{"prompt":"Question: What body part boasts three articulations and includes the patella?\nOptions:\n A. ankle\nB. hip\nC. elbow\nD. knee","completion":"knee\nExplanation: The knee includes three articulations. The femoropatellar joint is between the patella and distal femur. The patella, a sesamoid bone incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle of the anterior thigh, serves to protect this tendon from rubbing against the distal femur during knee movements. The medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints, between the condyles of the femur and condyles of the tibia, are modified hinge joints that allow for knee extension and flexion. During these movements, the condyles of the femur both roll and glide over the surface of the tibia. As the knee comes into full extension, a slight medial rotation of the femur serves to \u201clock\u201d the knee into its most stable, weight-bearing position. The reverse motion, a small lateral rotation of the femur, is required to initiate knee flexion. When the knee is flexed, some rotation of the leg is available. Two extrinsic ligaments, the tibial collateral ligament on the medial side and the fibular collateral ligament on the lateral side, serve to resist hyperextension or rotation of the extended knee joint. Two intracapsular ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament, span between the tibia and the inner aspects of the femoral condyles. The anterior cruciate ligament resists hyperextension of the knee, while the posterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior sliding of the femur, thus supporting the knee when it is flexed and weight bearing. The medial and lateral menisci, located between the femoral and tibial condyles, are articular discs that provide padding and improve the fit between the bones. The talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the articulation between the talus bone and the medial malleolus of the tibia, the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula. This is a uniaxial hinge joint that allows only dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. Gliding motions at the subtalar and intertarsal joints of the foot allow for inversion\/eversion of the foot. The ankle joint is supported on the medial side by the deltoid ligament, which prevents sideto-side motions of the talus at the talocrural joint and resists excessive eversion of the foot. The lateral ankle is supported by the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament. These support the ankle joint and also resist excess inversion of the foot. An inversion ankle sprain, a common injury, will result in injury to one or more of these lateral ankle ligaments."}

Tubulin is the protein that forms microtubules. Two forms of tubulin, alpha and beta, form dimers (pairs) which come together to form the hollow cylinders. The cylinders are twisted around each other to form the microtubules. Microtubules help the cell keep its shape. They hold organelles in place and allow them to move around the cell, and they form the mitotic spindle during cell division. Microtubules also make up parts of cilia and flagella, the organelles that help a cell move."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is any nonmetallic, inorganic solid that is strong enough for use in structural applications called?\nOptions:\n A. tissue\nB. ceramic\nC. metallic\nD. glass","completion":"ceramic\nExplanation: Ceramics A ceramic is any nonmetallic, inorganic solid that is strong enough for use in structural applications. Traditional ceramics, which are based on metal silicates or aluminosilicates, are the materials used to make pottery, china, bricks, and concrete. Modern ceramics contain a much wider range of components and can be classified as either ceramic oxides, which are based on metal oxides such as alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), and beryllia (BeO), or nonoxide ceramics, which are based on metal carbides such as silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC) and tungsten carbide (WC), or nitrides like silicon nitride (Si 3N4) and boron nitride (BN). All modern ceramics are hard, lightweight, and stable at very high temperatures. Unfortunately, however, they are also rather brittle, tending to crack or break under stresses that would cause metals to bend or dent. Thus a major challenge for materials scientists is to take advantage of the desirable properties of ceramics, such as their thermal and oxidative stability, chemical inertness, and toughness, while finding ways to decrease their brittleness to use them in new applications. Few metals can be used in jet engines, for example, because most lose mechanical strength and react with oxygen at the very high operating."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the process of a confined gas escaping through a tiny hole in its container called?\nOptions:\n A. effluent\nB. effusion\nC. dissipation\nD. dilution","completion":"effusion\nExplanation: Another related process is effusion. Effusion is the process of a confined gas escaping through a tiny hole in its container. Effusion can be observed by the fact that a helium-filled balloon will stop floating and sink to the floor after a day or so. This is because the helium gas effuses through tiny pores in the balloon. Both diffusion and effusion are related to the speed at which various gas molecules move. Gases that have a lower molar mass effuse and diffuse at a faster rate than gases that have a higher molar mass. While they are similar processes, there is a key difference between diffusion and effusion. Diffusion describes the process of a gas spreading out at a constant pressure, such as throughout a room. Effusion, on the other hand, describes the process of a gas spreading out from a high pressure surroundings to lower pressure surroundings."}

{"prompt":"Question: Compounds with metals and nonmetals sharing electrons are known as what kinds of compounds?\nOptions:\n A. acids\nB. atoms\nC. eons\nD. ions","completion":"ions\nExplanation: The Formation of Ionic Compounds Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic table."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the particular sequence of amino acids in a longer chain called?\nOptions:\n A. amino acid sequence\nB. atomic sequence\nC. molecular sequence\nD. carbon sequence","completion":"amino acid sequence\nExplanation: The dipeptide has a free amino group on one end of the molecule and a free carboxyl group on the other end. Each is capable of extending the chain through the formation of another peptide bond. The particular sequence of amino acids in a longer chain is called an amino acid sequence. By convention, the amino acid sequence is listed in the order such that the free amino group is on the left end of the molecule and the free carboxyl group is on the right end of the molecule. For example, suppose that a sequence of the amino acids glycine, tryptophan, and alanine is formed with the free amino group as part of the glycine and the free carboxyl group as part of the alanine. The amino acid sequence can be easily written using the abbreviations as Gly-Trp-Ala. This is a different sequence from Ala-Trp-Gly because the free amino and carboxyl groups would be on different amino acids in that case."}

{"prompt":"Question: The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from this?\nOptions:\n A. legs\nB. heart\nC. bladder\nD. brain","completion":"heart\nExplanation: External Respiration The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from the heart, where it branches and eventually becomes the capillary network composed of pulmonary capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries create the respiratory membrane with the alveoli (Figure 22.22). As the blood is pumped through this capillary network, gas exchange occurs. Although a small amount of the oxygen is able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli, most of the oxygen is picked up by erythrocytes (red blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process described later in this chapter. Oxygenated hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red oxygenated blood, which returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Carbon dioxide is released in the opposite direction of oxygen, from the blood to the alveoli. Some of the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin, but can also be dissolved in plasma or is present as a converted form, also explained in greater detail later in this chapter. External respiration occurs as a function of partial pressure differences in oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries."}

{"prompt":"Question: Collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers comprise what type of tissue?\nOptions:\n A. nucleus tissue\nB. connective tissue\nC. intestine tissue\nD. skin tissue","completion":"connective tissue\nExplanation: Connective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance Three main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen fiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while flexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body. Elastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main property of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are prominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column. Reticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain narrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the reticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the parenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ). All of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of polysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein core and."}

{"prompt":"Question: What crystals consist of molecules at the lattice points of the crystal, held together by relatively weak intermolecular forces?\nOptions:\n A. molecular crystals\nB. quartz crystals\nC. salt crystals\nD. healing crystals","completion":"molecular crystals\nExplanation: 4. Molecular crystals -- Molecular crystals typically consist of molecules at the lattice points of the crystal, held together by relatively weak intermolecular forces (see Figure below ). The intermolecular forces may be dispersion forces in the case of nonpolar crystals, or dipole-dipole forces in the case of polar crystals. Some molecular crystals, such as ice, have molecules held together by hydrogen bonds. When one of the noble gases is cooled and solidified, the lattice points are individual atoms rather than molecules. In all cases, the intermolecular forces holding the particles together are far weaker than either ionic or covalent bonds. As a result, the melting and boiling points of molecular crystals are much lower. Lacking ions or free electrons, molecular crystals are poor electrical conductors."}

{"prompt":"Question: Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires this?\nOptions:\n A. solids\nB. mineral\nC. energy\nD. metals","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Introduction Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency."}

{"prompt":"Question: In the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages called what?\nOptions:\n A. bronchi\nB. ion channels\nC. alveoli\nD. ectoderm","completion":"bronchi\nExplanation: In the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi. Air enters the lungs through the two primary (main) bronchi (singular: bronchus). Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which in turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. Like the trachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system\u2019s cues. In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles. They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases. The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (Figure 39.10). In the acinar region, the alveolar ducts."}

Human desire to see beyond what is possible with the naked eye led to the use of optical instruments. In this section we will examine microscopes, instruments for enlarging the detail that we cannot see with the unaided eye. The microscope is a multiple-element system having more than a single lens or mirror. (See Figure 26.15) A microscope can be made from two convex lenses. The image formed by the first element becomes the object for the second element. The second element forms its own image, which is the object for the third element, and so on. Ray tracing helps to visualize the image formed. If the device is composed of thin lenses and mirrors that obey the thin lens equations, then it is not difficult to describe their behavior numerically."}
{"prompt":"Question: Chemical formulas for ionic compounds are called what?\nOptions:\n A. electronic formulas\nB. ionic formulas\nC. velocity formulas\nD. magnetic formulas","completion":"ionic formulas\nExplanation: Chemical formulas for ionic compounds are called ionic formulas. A proper ionic formula has a cation and an anion in it; an ionic compound is never formed between two cations only or two anions only. The key to writing proper ionic formulas is simple: the total positive charge must balance the total negative charge. Because the charges on the ions are characteristic, sometimes we have to have more than one of a cation or an anion to balance the overall positive and negative charges. It is conventional to use the lowest ratio of ions that are needed to balance the charges. For example, consider the ionic compound between Na+ and Cl\u2212. Each ion has a single charge, one positive and one negative, so we need only one ion of each to balance the overall charge. When writing the ionic formula, we follow two additional conventions: (1) write the formula for the cation first and the formula for the anion next, but (2) do not write the charges on the ions. Thus, for the compound between Na+ and Cl\u2212, we have the ionic formula NaCl (Figure 3.5 \"NaCl = Table Salt\"). The formula Na2Cl2 also has balanced charges, but the convention is to use the lowest ratio of ions, which would be one of each. (Remember from our conventions for writing formulas that we don\u2019t write a 1 subscript if there is only one atom of a particular element present. ) For the ionic compound between magnesium cations (Mg2+) and oxide anions (O2\u2212), again we need only one of each ion to balance the charges. By convention, the formula is MgO. For the ionic compound between Mg2+ ions and Cl\u2212 ions, we now consider the fact that the charges have different magnitudes, 2+ on the magnesium ion and 1\u2212 on the chloride ion. To balance the charges with the lowest number of ions possible, we need to have two chloride ions Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: One of the most advanced uses of what in medicine is the positron emission tomography scanner, which detects the activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose?\nOptions:\n A. radionuclides\nB. quarks\nC. radioisotopes\nD. membranes","completion":"radioisotopes\nExplanation: Interventional Radiologist The controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional radiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many conditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-surgically, reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past, the only options for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the administration of drugs to treat cancer). Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others could require the surgeon to remove too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and certain tumors do not respond well to it anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the tumors by disrupting their blood supply, which they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called radioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient\u2019s blood vessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive \u201cseeds\u201d into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the days and weeks following the procedure, the radiation emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills the tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment. Radioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the most advanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The PET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient\u2019s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the most metabolically active tissues show up as bright \u201chot spots\u201d on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some cancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction."}

{"prompt":"Question: What happens if a catalyst runs out?\nOptions:\n A. variety slows\nB. reaction slows\nC. variety increases\nD. reaction increases","completion":"reaction slows\nExplanation: Chemistry in Everyday Life Transition Metal Catalysts One of the most important applications of transition metals is as industrial catalysts. As you recall from the chapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is regenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one or more catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts well suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid worldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are made with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see Figure 19.26). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective, reacting with one specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more economical and more environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of existing systems are important areas of current research."}
{"prompt":"Question: Cytokinesis divides what part of the cell into two distinctive cells?\nOptions:\n A. DNA\nB. cell wall\nC. nucleus\nD. cytoplasm","completion":"cytoplasm\nExplanation: The Cell Cycle One \u201cturn\u201d or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. Interphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase most of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new, fully functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells."}
{"prompt":"Question: The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a what?\nOptions:\n A. placenta\nB. stomach\nC. ovum\nD. umbilical cord","completion":"placenta\nExplanation: The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a placenta. The yolk sac stores enough food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus. After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother\u2019s pouch, where it clings to a nipple. It remains inside the pouch for several months while it continues to grow and develop. Even after the offspring is big enough to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and nourishment. Eventually, the offspring is mature enough to remain outside the pouch on its own."}

{"prompt":"Question: Energy is absorbed in the process of converting a liquid at its boiling point into a what?\nOptions:\n A. mesh\nB. plasma\nC. solid\nD. gas","completion":"gas\nExplanation: Energy is absorbed in the process of converting a liquid at its boiling point into a gas. As with the melting of a solid, the temperature of a boiling liquid remains constant and the input of energy goes into changing the state. The molar heat of vaporization of a substance is the heat absorbed by one mole of that substance as it is converted from a liquid to a gas. As a gas condenses to a liquid, heat is released. The molar heat of condensation of a substance is the heat released by one mole of that substance as it is converted from a gas to a liquid. Since vaporization and condensation of a given substance are the exact opposite processes, the numerical value of the molar heat of vaporization is the same as the numerical value of the molar heat of condensation, but opposite in sign. In other words, ."}

{"prompt":"Question: What item starts puberty in girls?\nOptions:\n A. the hypothalamus\nB. the ovary\nC. the uterus\nD. the thyroid","completion":"the hypothalamus\nExplanation: Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus \u201ctells\u201d the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. Two pituitary hormones are involved: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) . These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen . Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and other physical changes of puberty. It stimulates growth and development of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see Figure below ).

{"prompt":"Question: What is one way of classifying organisms called?\nOptions:\n A. cluster\nB. clade\nC. tuck\nD. spasm","completion":"clade\nExplanation: One way of classifying organisms that shows phylogeny is by using the clade. A clade is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants. Clades are based on cladistics. This is a method of comparing traits in related species to determine ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are represented by cladograms, like the one in Figure below . This cladogram represents the mammal and reptile clades. The reptile clade includes birds. It shows that birds evolved from reptiles. Linnaeus classified mammals, reptiles, and birds in separate classes. This masks their evolutionary relationships."}

{"prompt":"Question: A genetic molecule is called dna, which stands for this?\nOptions:\n A. di-nitrous ammonia\nB. deoxyribonucleic acid\nC. dark nitrogen amine\nD. dense ribonucleic acid","completion":"deoxyribonucleic acid\nExplanation: How Sciences Interconnect DNA in Forensics and Paternity The genetic material for all living things is a polymer of four different molecules, which are themselves a combination of three subunits. The genetic information, the code for developing an organism, is contained in the specific sequence of the four molecules, similar to the way the letters of the alphabet can be sequenced to form words that convey information. The information in a DNA sequence is used to form two other types of polymers, one of which are proteins. The proteins interact to form a specific type of organism with individual characteristics. A genetic molecule is called DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The four molecules that make up DNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a single- or double-ringed molecule containing nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen called a nitrogenous base. Each base is bonded to a five-carbon sugar called deoxyribose. The sugar is in turn bonded to a phosphate group (\u2212PO 4 3\u2212) When new DNA is made, a polymerization reaction occurs that binds the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar group of a second nucleotide. The nitrogenous bases of each nucleotide stick out from this sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA is actually formed from two such polymers coiled around each other and held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Thus, the two backbones are on the outside of the coiled pair of strands, and the bases are on the inside. The shape of the two strands wound around each other is called a double helix (see Figure 20.18). It probably makes sense that the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA of a cat differs from those of a dog. But it is also true that the sequences of the DNA in the cells of two individual pugs differ. Likewise, the sequences of DNA in you and a sibling differ (unless your sibling is an identical twin), as do those between you and an unrelated individual. However, the DNA sequences of two related individuals are more similar than the sequences of two unrelated individuals, and these similarities in sequence can be observed in various ways. This is the principle behind DNA fingerprinting, which is a method used to determine whether two DNA samples came from related (or the same) individuals or unrelated individuals."}

{"prompt":"Question: Anaerobic respiration takes place without what?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. nitrogen\nC. movement\nD. carbon","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: Aerobic respiration , which takes place in the presence of oxygen, evolved after oxygen was added to Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This type of respiration is useful today because the atmosphere is now 21% oxygen. However, some anaerobic organisms that evolved before the atmosphere contained oxygen have survived to the present. Therefore, anaerobic respiration , which takes place without oxygen, must also have advantages."}

Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology."}

They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which the force is applied. Two examples of machines that work this way are the claw ends of hammers and flagpole pulleys. You can see in the Figure below how each of these machines works. In both cases, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine."}
{"prompt":"Question: Anosmia, the loss of what sense, is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed?\nOptions:\n A. general sensitivity\nB. taste\nC. balance\nD. smell","completion":"smell\nExplanation: Nervous System Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually because of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis. The new neurons extend their axons into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these neurons to be replaced is lost with age. Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory neurons with no new neurons born to replace them. Smell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There are only five tastes sensed by the tongue, and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory experience of food is the result of odor molecules associated with the food, both as food is moved into the mouth, and therefore passes under the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity. Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food. As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many sufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt. The problem with this solution, however, is that this increases sodium intake, which can lead to cardiovascular problems through water retention and the associated increase in blood pressure."}
{"prompt":"Question: Which atomic model shows that the distances of electrons from the nucleus is not a fixed value?\nOptions:\n A. the electron model\nB. the distance model\nC. the equivocation model\nD. the quantum model","completion":"the quantum model\nExplanation: In the Bohr model, the atom is viewed as a densely packed nucleus comprised of neutrons and protons that is surrounded by electrons at fixed distances, which correspond to specific energy levels. However, the quantum model showed that the distances between electrons and the nucleus are not really fixed. Due to their wave-like nature, we cannot pinpoint the exact location of an electron that is in motion, but we can determine the probability that a given electron will be in a particular region in three-dimensional space. Schr\u04e7dinger\u2019s equations are used to determine the position of a specific electron with respect to a nearby nucleus. The region in space in which an electron is most likely to be found is referred to as an orbital ."}

{"prompt":"Question: If solutions of differing osmolarities are present on opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane, solvent will transfer from what to what, in terms of osmolarity of the solution?\nOptions:\n A. low to low\nB. low to high\nC. high to high\nD. high to low","completion":"low to high\nExplanation: osmol = M \u00d7 i If more than one solute is present in a solution, the individual osmolarities are additive to get the total osmolarity of the solution. Solutions that have the same osmolarity have the same osmotic pressure. If solutions of differing osmolarities are present on opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane, solvent will transfer from the lower-osmolarity solution to the higher-osmolarity solution. Counterpressure exerted on the highosmolarity solution will reduce or halt the solvent transfer. An even higher pressure can be exerted to force solvent from the high-osmolarity solution to the low-osmolarity solution, a process called reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is used to make potable water from saltwater where sources of fresh water are scarce."}

{"prompt":"Question: The heart and the arteries and veins are associated with what system of the body?\nOptions:\n A. cardiovascular\nB. metabolism\nC. digestion\nD. respiration","completion":"cardiovascular\nExplanation: Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure and resistance within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance. Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high blood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly stressed by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured\u2014which means that hypertension can promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it. Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars it, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and cholesterol can seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = \u201cporridge\u201d) describes the mealy deposits (Figure 20.14)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Some metals, such as gold and platinum, do not corrode easily because they are very resistant to what?\nOptions:\n A. evaporation\nB. precipitation\nC. oxidation\nD. heat","completion":"oxidation\nExplanation: Some metals, such as gold and platinum, do not corrode easily because they are very resistant to oxidation by common substances. Some other metals begin to be oxidized, but are further protected from additional corrosion by a coating formed on the surface. Aluminum reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide, which remains tightly packed on the surface. The aluminum oxide prevents the interior of the aluminum from corroding. Not all corrosion is a result of reaction with oxygen. Copper corrodes by reaction with carbon dioxide to form copper(II) carbonate. This distinctive green compound is also called patina and prevents the copper underneath from further corrosion (see Statue of Liberty in the Figure below )."}

{"prompt":"Question: Two types of interference found in waves are constructive and what else?\nOptions:\n A. osmotic\nB. conductive\nC. destructive\nD. primitive","completion":"destructive\nExplanation: Discussion The intensity goes up by a factor of 4 when the amplitude doubles. This answer is a little disquieting. The two individual waves each have intensities of 1.00 W\/m 2 , yet their sum has an intensity of 4.00 W\/m 2 , which may appear to violate conservation of energy. This violation, of course, cannot happen. What does happen is intriguing. The area over which the intensity is 4.00 W\/m 2 is much less than the area covered by the two waves before they interfered. There are other areas where the intensity is zero. The addition of waves is not as simple as our first look in Superposition and Interference suggested. We actually get a pattern of both constructive interference and destructive interference whenever two waves are added. For example, if we have two stereo speakers putting out 1.00 W\/m 2 each, there will be places in the room where the intensity is 4.00 W\/m 2 , other places where the intensity is zero, and others in between. Figure 16.45 shows what this interference might look like. We will pursue interference patterns elsewhere in this text."}

{"prompt":"Question: In what form is the heat absorbed when you heat ice and it reaches a temperature of 0 c?\nOptions:\n A. geothermal energy\nB. mechanical energy\nC. potential energy\nD. radiation energy","completion":"potential energy\nExplanation: The heating curve shown is for water but other substances have similarly shaped heating curves. Suppose you begin with solid water (ice) at -30\u00b0C and add heat at a constant rate. The heat you add in the beginning will be absorbed as kinetic energy and the temperature of the solid will increase. When you reach a temperature of 0\u00b0C (the melting point for water), the heat you add is no longer absorbed as kinetic energy. Instead, the added heat is absorbed as potential energy and the particles separate from each other. During the flat part of the curve labeled \u201cmelting\u201d, heat is being added constantly but the temperature does not increase. At the left edge of this flat line, the water is solid; by the time enough heat has been added to get to the right edge, the water is liquid, but maintains the same temperature. Once all the water is in the liquid form, the added heat will once again be absorbed as kinetic energy and the temperature will increase again. During the time labeled \u201cwater being heated as a liquid\u201d, all the added heat is absorbed as kinetic energy."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the most important characteristic of a homogeneous mixture?\nOptions:\n A. uniform composition throughout\nB. very reactive\nC. high density\nD. nonreactive","completion":"uniform composition throughout\nExplanation: A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. The salt water described above is homogeneous because the dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire salt water sample. Often it is easy to confuse a homogeneous mixture with a pure substance because they are both uniform. The difference is that the composition of the substance is always the same. The amount of salt in the salt water can vary from one sample to another. All solutions would be considered homogeneous because the dissolved material is present in the same amount throughout the solution."}

A wetland is an area that is covered with water, or at least has very soggy soil, during all or part of the year. Certain species of plants thrive in wetlands, and they are rich ecosystems. Freshwater wetlands are usually found at the edges of steams, rivers, ponds, or lakes. Wetlands can also be found at the edges of seas."}
{"prompt":"Question: What category of elements are chacterized by their ability to reflect light, called luster, their high electrical and thermal conductivity, their high heat capacity, and their malleability and ductility?\nOptions:\n A. metals\nB. halogens\nC. nonmetals\nD. noble gases","completion":"metals\nExplanation: Metallic Solids Metals are characterized by their ability to reflect light, called luster, their high electrical and thermal conductivity, their high heat capacity, and their malleability and ductility. Every lattice point in a pure metallic element is occupied by an atom of the same metal. The packing efficiency in metallic crystals tends to be high, so the resulting metallic solids are dense, with each atom having as many as 12 nearest neighbors. Bonding in metallic solids is quite different from the bonding in the other kinds of solids we have discussed. Because all the atoms are the same, there can be no ionic bonding, yet metals always contain too few electrons or valence orbitals to form covalent bonds with each of their neighbors. Instead, the valence electrons are delocalized throughout the crystal, providing a strong cohesive force that holds the metal atoms together."}
{"prompt":"Question: What man-made devices in space are used to observe the earth's surface?\nOptions:\n A. crystals\nB. satellites\nC. telescopes\nD. sensors","completion":"satellites\nExplanation: Observations can happen on many scales.

{"prompt":"Question: The conversion of food that is consumed to nutrients involves what two major processes:\nOptions:\n A. secrete and absorption\nB. digestion and absorption\nC. untangling and absorption\nD. absorption and excretion","completion":"digestion and absorption\nExplanation: 16.2 | Digestive System By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Explain the processes of digestion and absorption \u2022 Explain the specialized functions of the organs involved in processing food in the body \u2022 Describe the ways in which organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients \u2022 Describe the essential nutrients required for cellular function that cannot be synthesized by the animal body \u2022 Describe how excess carbohydrates and energy are stored in the body All living organisms need nutrients to survive. While plants can obtain nutrients from their roots and the energy molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars. However, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular function. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, which are later absorbed by the body. This happens by both physical means, such as chewing, and by chemical means. One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure. Taking in more food energy than is used in activity leads to storage of the excess in the form of fat deposits. The rise in obesity and the resulting diseases like type 2 diabetes makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important."}

Chemical equations in which heat is shown as either a reactant or a product are called thermochemical equations. In this reaction, the system consists of aluminum, iron, and oxygen atoms; everything else, including the container, makes up the surroundings. During the reaction, so much heat is produced that the iron liquefies. Eventually, the system cools; the iron solidifies as heat is transferred to the surroundings. A process in which heat (q) is transferred from a system to its surroundings is described as exothermic. By convention, q < 0 for an exothermic reaction."}

Microfilaments are mostly concentrated just beneath the cell membrane, where they support the cell and help the cell keep its shape. Microfilaments form cytoplasmatic extensions, such as pseudopodia and microvilli, which allow certain cells to move. The actin of the microfilaments interacts with the protein myosin to cause contraction in muscle cells. Microfilaments are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape, such as phagocytes (white blood cells that search the body for bacteria and other invaders)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the type of reproduction where part of the parent plant is used to generate a new plant?\nOptions:\n A. sexual reproduction\nB. coaxed reproduction\nC. byproduct reproduction\nD. asexual reproduction","completion":"asexual reproduction\nExplanation: 32.3 Asexual Reproduction Many plants reproduce asexually as well as sexually. In asexual reproduction, part of the parent plant is used to generate a new plant. Grafting, layering, and micropropagation are some methods used for artificial asexual reproduction. The new plant is genetically identical to the parent plant from which the stock has been taken. Asexually reproducing plants thrive well in stable environments. Plants have different life spans, dependent on species, genotype, and environmental conditions. Parts of the plant, such as regions containing meristematic tissue, continue to grow, while other parts experience programmed cell death. Leaves that are no longer photosynthetically active are shed from the plant as part of senescence, and the nutrients from these leaves are recycled by the plant. Other factors, including the presence of hormones, are known to play a role in delaying senescence."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because opposite charges attract, oppositely charged ions attract each other to form what?\nOptions:\n A. nuclear bonds\nB. particle bonds\nC. soluble bonds\nD. ionic bonds","completion":"ionic bonds\nExplanation: until all atoms have octets. Because some atoms will lose electrons and some atoms will gain electrons, there is no overall change in the number of electrons, but individual atoms acquire a nonzero electric charge. Those that lose electrons become positively charged, and those that gain electrons become negatively charged. Charged atoms are called ions. Because opposite charges attract (while like charges repel), these oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming ionic bonds. The resulting compounds are called ionic compounds and are the primary subject of this chapter. The second way for an atom to obtain an octet of electrons is by sharing electrons with another atom. These shared electrons simultaneously occupy the outermost shell of more than one atom. The bond made by electron sharing is called a covalent bond. Covalent bonding and covalent compounds will be discussed in Chapter 4 \"Covalent Bonding and Simple Molecular Compounds\"."}

{"prompt":"Question: An individual with the appropriate number of what for their species is called euploid; abnormalities in this number include trisomy and monosomy?\nOptions:\n A. ribosomes\nB. neutrons\nC. genes\nD. chromosomes","completion":"chromosomes\nExplanation: Aneuploidy An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes. This underscores the importance of \u201cgene dosage\u201d in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded by that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (Figure 13.7)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Torpor, a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions, includes what long winter 'sleep'?\nOptions:\n A. fermentation\nB. pollination\nC. hibernation\nD. relaxation","completion":"hibernation\nExplanation: Energy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity The more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR. The average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal\u2019s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR. For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. The relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses > forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals\/biennials. Energy Requirements Related to Environment Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F), while a bear\u2019s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37\u00b0 C (99\u00b0 F). If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation. Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds. While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to conserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature."}
{"prompt":"Question: In mammals, hair or fur help conserve bodily what?\nOptions:\n A. food\nB. heat\nC. energy\nD. water","completion":"heat\nExplanation: Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator. Even humans automatically contract these muscles when they are cold, causing goosebumps (see Figure below ). Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body. This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates."}
{"prompt":"Question: The tidal forces near what celestial phenomena are so great they can actually tear matter from a companion star?\nOptions:\n A. dwarf star\nB. large holes\nC. wormholes\nD. black holes","completion":"black holes\nExplanation: Tides are not unique to Earth but occur in many astronomical systems. The most extreme tides occur where the gravitational force is the strongest and varies most rapidly, such as near black holes (see Figure 6.26). A few likely candidates for black holes have been observed in our galaxy. These have masses greater than the Sun but have diameters only a few kilometers across. The tidal forces near them are so great that they can actually tear matter from a companion star."}

Others are produced by the pancreas and secreted into the duodenum."}
{"prompt":"Question: The rate of a reaction can be expressed either in terms of the decrease in the amount of what or the increase in the amount of a product per unit time?\nOptions:\n A. reactant\nB. plasma\nC. sulfate\nD. isotope","completion":"reactant\nExplanation: Summary 12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates The rate of a reaction can be expressed either in terms of the decrease in the amount of a reactant or the increase in the amount of a product per unit time. Relations between different rate expressions for a given reaction are derived directly from the stoichiometric coefficients of the equation representing the reaction. 12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates The rate of a chemical reaction is affected by several parameters. Reactions involving two phases proceed more rapidly when there is greater surface area contact. If temperature or reactant concentration is increased, the rate of a given reaction generally increases as well. A catalyst can increase the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway that causes the activation energy of the reaction to decrease. 12.3 Rate Laws Rate laws provide a mathematical description of how changes in the amount of a substance affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the amount of each substance affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the reaction. Reaction orders are typically first order, second order, or zero order, but fractional and even negative orders are possible. 12.4 Integrated Rate Laws Differential rate laws can be determined by the method of initial rates or other methods. We measure values for the initial rates of a reaction at different concentrations of the reactants. From these measurements, we determine the order of the reaction in each reactant. Integrated rate laws are determined by integration of the corresponding differential."}

{"prompt":"Question: What device measures current that flows through wire?\nOptions:\n A. protractor\nB. ammeter\nC. resistor attachment\nD. Geiger counter","completion":"ammeter\nExplanation: The device in the circuit in Figure above is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: The product of a wave's wavelength and its frequency is what?\nOptions:\n A. trough\nB. speed\nC. velocity\nD. amplitude","completion":"speed\nExplanation: The product of a wave's wavelength (\u03bb) and its frequency (\u03bd), \u03bb\u03bd, is the speed of the wave. Thus, for electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum: c = 2.998 \u00d7 10 8 ms \u22121 = \u03bb\u03bd Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases. The inverse proportionality is illustrated in Figure 6.3. This figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What force is caused by microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections colliding?\nOptions:\n A. gravitational\nB. motion\nC. friction\nD. tension","completion":"friction\nExplanation: Every surface has microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections, emphasized as in the image above. If we try to slide the top block over the lower block, there will be numerous collisions as the bumps impact each other. The forward motion causes the collisions with bumps which then exert a force in opposite way the block is moving. The force of friction always opposes whatever motion is causing the friction."}
{"prompt":"Question: Cellular respiration is the reverse or opposite of what?\nOptions:\n A. spermatogenesis\nB. reproduction\nC. photosynthesis\nD. glycolysis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: Specifically, during cellular respiration, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP ( Figure below ). ATP , or adenosine triphosphate, is chemical energy the cell can use. It is the molecule that provides energy for your cells to perform work, such as moving your muscles as you walk down the street. But cellular respiration is slightly more complicated than just converting the energy from glucose into ATP. Cellular respiration can be described as the reverse or opposite of photosynthesis. During cellular respiration, glucose, in the presence of oxygen, is converted into carbon dioxide and water. Recall that carbon dioxide and water are the starting products of photosynthesis. What are the products of photosynthesis?."}

Troposphere","completion":"the stratosphere\nExplanation: There are very few gas molecules in the mesosphere. This means that there is little matter to absorb the Sun\u2019s rays and heat the air. Most of the heat that enters the mesosphere comes from the stratosphere below. That\u2019s why the mesosphere is warmest at the bottom."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the chemical formulas for covalent compounds referred to as?\nOptions:\n A. nucleus formulas\nB. molecular formulas\nC. magnetic formulas\nD. Electron Formulas","completion":"molecular formulas\nExplanation: The chemical formulas for covalent compounds are referred to as molecular formulas because these compounds exist as separate, discrete molecules. Typically, a molecular formula begins with the nonmetal that is closest to the lower left corner of the periodic table, except that hydrogen is almost never written first (H2O is the prominent exception). Then the other nonmetal symbols are listed. Numerical subscripts are used if there is more than one of a particular atom. For example, we have already seen CH4, the molecular formula for methane. Naming binary (two-element) covalent compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds. The first element in the formula is simply listed using the name of the element. The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix -ide. A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 4.1 \"Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds\" lists these numerical prefixes. Normally, no prefix is added to the first element\u2019s name if there is only one atom of the first element in a molecule. If the second element is oxygen, the trailing vowel is usually omitted from the end of a polysyllabic prefix but not a monosyllabic one (that is, we would say \u201cmonoxide\u201d rather than \u201cmonooxide\u201d and \u201ctrioxide\u201d rather than \u201ctroxide\u201d).

{"prompt":"Question: What is the first part of the large intestine, where wastes enter from the small intestine?\nOptions:\n A. the cecum\nB. bowel\nC. esophagus\nD. stomach","completion":"the cecum\nExplanation: The cecum is the first part of the large intestine, where wastes enter from the small intestine. The wastes are in a liquid state. As they passes through the colon, which is the second part of the large intestine, excess water is absorbed. The remaining solid wastes are called feces . Feces accumulate in the rectum, which is the third part of the large intestine. As the rectum fills, the feces become compacted. After a certain amount of feces accumulate, they are eliminated from the body. A sphincter controls the anus and opens to let feces pass through."}
{"prompt":"Question: The cell starting meiosis is called a what?\nOptions:\n A. primary oocyte\nB. secondary oocyte\nC. primary gamete\nD. zygote","completion":"primary oocyte\nExplanation: The cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 43.13. This cell will start the first meiotic division and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage. At adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm."}

{"prompt":"Question: What body part does encephalitis attack?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. brain\nC. liver\nD. heart","completion":"brain\nExplanation: Encephalitis is a brain infection ( Figure below ). If you have encephalitis, you are likely to have a fever and headache or feel drowsy and confused. The disease is most often caused by viruses. The immune system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than good. The immune system\u2019s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull. This may injure the brain and even cause death. Medicines can help fight some viral infections of the brain, but not all infections."}
{"prompt":"Question: What process typically occurs to metal exposed to outside elements?\nOptions:\n A. shrinkage\nB. corrosion\nC. extraction\nD. explosion","completion":"corrosion\nExplanation: Metal exposed to the outside elements will usually corrode if not protected.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the study of matter and the changes that material substances undergo.\nOptions:\n A. physiology\nB. biology\nC. chemistry\nD. geology","completion":"chemistry\nExplanation: Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that material substances undergo. Of all the scientific disciplines, it is perhaps the most extensively connected to other fields of study. Geologists who want to locate new mineral or oil deposits use chemical techniques to analyze and identify rock samples. Oceanographers use chemistry to track ocean currents, determine the flux of nutrients into the sea, and measure the rate of exchange of nutrients between ocean layers. Engineers consider the relationships between the structures and the properties of substances when they specify materials for various uses. Physicists take advantage of the properties of substances to detect new subatomic particles. Astronomers use chemical signatures to determine the age and distance of stars and thus answer questions about how stars form and how old the universe is. The entire subject of environmental science depends on chemistry to explain the origin and impacts of phenomena such as air pollution, ozone layer depletion, and global warming. The disciplines that focus on living organisms and their interactions with the physical world rely heavily on biochemistry, the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes. A living cell contains a large collection of complex molecules that carry out thousands of chemical reactions, including those that are necessary for."}

{"prompt":"Question: Bees are naturalized on every continent except which?\nOptions:\n A. antarctica\nB. Australia\nC. North America\nD. Africa","completion":"antarctica\nExplanation: Honeybees are one of the most well-known insects on the planet. Bees are naturalized on every continent except Antarctica. Honeybees have a highly developed social structure and depend on their community, or colony, for survival, with a colony containing up to 20,000 bees. When bees search plants for nectar, pollen sticks to the fuzzy hairs that cover their hind legs. At the next flower, some of the pollen rubs off and fertilizes that flower. In this way, bees help improve fruit production. Bees pollinate an estimated 130 different varieties of fruit, flowers, nuts and vegetables in the United States alone. Farmers obviously depend on bees to pollinate crops, such as fruit and nuts, but in recent years thousands of bee colonies have disappeared. This could be a devastating issue for farmers. Can anything be done?

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term that refers to stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes?\nOptions:\n A. biomass energy\nB. nuclear energy\nC. potential energy\nD. starch energy","completion":"biomass energy\nExplanation: The stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes is called biomass energy. The organic matter may be trees or other plants, or it may be wastes from homes and industries. When biomass is burned, it produces thermal energy that can be used for heating homes, cooking, or generating electricity. Biomass\u2014especially wood\u2014is an important energy source in the poorer nations where most people can\u2019t afford fossil fuels. However, burning biomass releases air pollution and contributes to global climate change. Biomass can be used to make ethanol, a fuel that is added to gasoline. Although ethanol releases less pollution than gasoline, large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it (see Figure below ). This reduces the amount of land available for food production."}

Consider a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas at a certain temperature. Use the formula for kinetic energy to explain why the hydrogen molecules move faster than the oxygen molecules. Then explain why there\u2019s no hydrogen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere, and why the moon has no atmosphere at all."}
{"prompt":"Question: Very large stars eventually become what extremely dense space regions, which are so dense that no light can escape from them?\nOptions:\n A. black holes\nB. worm holes\nC. dark matter\nD. moons","completion":"black holes\nExplanation: The largest-mass stars become black holes . These extremely large stars end their life in the same way as a medium-mass star in that they become a supernova. After the outer layers are blown away in the supernova, however, the core of the star shrinks down in volume but still has a huge mass. The density of this object is extremely high, even denser than neutron stars. This dense object will have a gravitational force so large that not even light can escape from the body. (A companion topic to this occurs in The General Theory of Relativity where we see than extremely strong gravitational attraction can even attract light. ) These objects appear black because light cannot leave them, that is, they pull all light back to their surface. Black holes capture everything nearby due to their massive gravity and so they grow in size. Black holes are a common topic for science fiction but keep in mind, they are simply a very dense ball of matter with intense gravitational attraction."}

It may not have been very long before the dog would reliably follow the command in order to get the treat. This is an example of conditioning that involves a reward."}
{"prompt":"Question: The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell is what?\nOptions:\n A. relatively high\nB. relatively normal\nC. relatively low\nD. relative","completion":"relatively high\nExplanation: The Cell Wall The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell is relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity. It is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical composition of the cell walls varies between archaea and bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides containing both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. Proteins normally have only L-amino acids; as a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development. There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan. S-layer (surface layer) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria. Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining. Note that all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias, Spirochetes, Cyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram (1853\u20131938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms (Figure 22.15). Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids. Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer. The chemistry of this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the natural movement called within your intestines?\nOptions:\n A. proteolysis\nB. peristalsis\nC. progress\nD. fibroblasts","completion":"peristalsis\nExplanation: When most of the chyme has been absorbed, the small intestinal wall becomes less distended. At this point, the localized segmentation process is replaced by transport movements. The duodenal mucosa secretes the hormone motilin, which initiates peristalsis in the form of a migrating motility complex. These complexes, which begin in the duodenum, force chyme through a short section of the small intestine and then stop. The next contraction begins a little bit farther down than the first, forces chyme a bit farther through the small intestine, then stops. These complexes move slowly down the small intestine, forcing chyme on the way, taking around 90 to 120 minutes to finally reach the end of the ileum. At this point, the process is repeated, starting in the duodenum."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are genes that are close together on the same chromosome called?\nOptions:\n A. mutated genes\nB. infected genes\nC. linked genes\nD. stored genes","completion":"linked genes\nExplanation: Linked genes are genes that are close together on the same chromosome.

{"prompt":"Question: What do we call the only light that people can see?\nOptions:\n A. visible light\nB. wave light\nC. spectral light\nD. natural light","completion":"visible light\nExplanation: The only light that people can see is called visible light . This light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light. Within the visible range, we see light of different wavelengths as different colors of light, from red light, which has the longest wavelength, to violet light, which has the shortest wavelength (see Figure below ). When all of the wavelengths of visible light are combined, as they are in sunlight, visible light appears white.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for the unconscious movements controlled by the somatic nervous system?\nOptions:\n A. senses\nB. mechanisms\nC. tremors\nD. reflexes","completion":"reflexes\nExplanation: The somatic nervous system also controls some unconscious movements, called reflexes. A reflex is a very rapid motor response that is not directed by the brain. In a reflex, nerve impulses travel to and from the spinal cord in a reflex arc , like the one in Figure below . In this example, the person jerks his hand away from the flame without any conscious thought. It happens unconsciously because the nerve impulses bypass the brain."}
{"prompt":"Question: Phosphorus exists as several allotropes, the most common being red, black, and what?\nOptions:\n A. purple phosphorus\u200b\nB. yellow phosphorous\nC. green phosphorus\u200b\nD. white phosphorus","completion":"white phosphorus\nExplanation: Phosphorus exists as several allotropes, the most common being red, black, and white phosphorus. White phosphorus consists of tetrahedral P4 molecules and melts at 44.15\u00b0C; it is converted to red phosphorus by heating at 400\u00b0C for several hours. The chemical differences between red and white phosphorus are considerable: white phosphorus burns in air, whereas red phosphorus is stable; white phosphorus is soluble in organic compounds, whereas red phosphorus is not; white phosphorus melts at 44.15\u00b0C, whereas red phosphorus melts at 597\u00b0C. If the enthalpy of fusion of white phosphorus is 0.659 kJ\/mol, what is its \u0394S? Black phosphorus is even less reactive than red.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the purpose of utilizing careful farming practices such as rotating crops or planting nutrient rich crops?\nOptions:\n A. improve sediment quality\nB. improve photosynthesis quality\nC. improve soil texture\nD. improve soil quality","completion":"improve soil quality\nExplanation: Careful farming helps to keep up soil quality each season. One way is to plant different crops each year. Another is to alternate the crops planted in each row of the field. These techniques preserve and replenish soil nutrients. Planting nutrient rich cover crops helps the soil. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of a field, or building terraces into steeper slopes all help to hold soil in place ( Figure below ). No-till or low-till farming disturbs the ground as little as possible during planting."}

{"prompt":"Question: All the blood in the human body is filtered about 60 times a day by what?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. kidneys\nC. heart\nD. liver","completion":"kidneys\nExplanation: blood containing the metabolic wastes from cells. All the blood in the human body is filtered about 60 times a day by the kidneys. The nephrons remove wastes, concentrate them, and form urine that is collected in the bladder. Internally, the kidney has three regions\u2014an outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis, which is the expanded end of the ureter. The renal cortex contains the nephrons\u2014the functional unit of the kidney. The renal pelvis collects the urine and leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney. The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder."}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of energy is specifically defined as the energy that is available to do work?\nOptions:\n A. used\nB. new\nC. free\nD. old","completion":"free\nExplanation: 6.2 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy Energy comes in many different forms. Objects in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects in motion. Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work, and thus, have potential energy. Molecules also have potential energy because the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living cells depend on the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy that is available to do work. The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and this change is referred to as \u2206G. The \u2206G of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy, respectively. A reaction with a negative \u2206G that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. One with a positive \u2206G that requires energy input is called an endergonic reaction. Exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their products have less energy than their reactants. The products of endergonic reactions have a higher energy state than the reactants, and so these are nonspontaneous reactions. However, all reactions (including spontaneous -\u2206G reactions) require an initial input of energy in order to reach the transition state, at which they\u2019ll proceed. This initial input of energy is called the activation energy."}

Conversely, four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte."}
{"prompt":"Question: What element do plants use to store energy as atp?\nOptions:\n A. nitrogen\nB. chlorophyll\nC. carbon\nD. oxygen","completion":"oxygen\nExplanation: The next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (N); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. Nitrogen is also used in the synthesis of some vitamins. Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form water. Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of ATP. Phosphorus (P), another macromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids. As part of ATP, phosphorus enables food energy to be converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy during photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration. Sulfur is part of certain amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, and is present in several coenzymes. Sulfur also plays a role in photosynthesis as part of the electron transport chain, where hydrogen gradients play a key role in the conversion of light energy into ATP. Potassium (K) is important because of its role in regulating stomatal opening and closing. As the openings for gas exchange, stomata help maintain a healthy water balance; a potassium ion pump supports this process."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for an organism\u2019s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both the physically visible and the non-expressed alleles?\nOptions:\n A. genotype\nB. divergency\nC. trait map\nD. phenotype","completion":"genotype\nExplanation: Phenotypes and Genotypes Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. An organism\u2019s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both the physically visible and the non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype. Mendel\u2019s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. For example, the phenotypes that Mendel observed in his crosses between pea plants with differing traits are connected to the diploid genotypes of the plants in the P, F1, and F2 generations. We will use a second trait that Mendel investigated, seed color, as an example. Seed color is governed by a single gene with two alleles. The yellow-seed allele is dominant and the green-seed allele is recessive. When true-breeding plants were cross-fertilized, in which one parent had yellow seeds and one had green seeds, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow seeds. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow seeds. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green seeds was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring (Figure 8.5). Therefore, the F1 plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow seeds. The P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are homozygous for a gene have two identical alleles, one on each of their homologous chromosomes. The genotype is often written as YY or yy, for which each letter represents one of the two alleles in the genotype. The dominant allele is capitalized and the recessive allele is lower case. The letter used for the gene (seed color in this case) is usually related to the dominant trait (yellow allele, in this case, or \u201cY\u201d). Mendel\u2019s parental pea plants always bred true because both."}
{"prompt":"Question: The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of this?\nOptions:\n A. steroid hormones\nB. ammonia hormones\nC. Somatostatin\nD. Thrombopoietin","completion":"steroid hormones\nExplanation: Connections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups and proceeds in only one direction. The process cannot be reversed. Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids. Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis. Fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups. The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA that proceeds into the citric acid cycle."}
{"prompt":"Question: Carbon monoxide, radon gas, dust and pet dander are sources of what kind of pollution?\nOptions:\n A. indoor air pollution\nB. noise pollution\nC. light pollution\nD. sound pollution","completion":"indoor air pollution\nExplanation: One source of indoor air pollution is radon gas. Radon is a radioactive gas that may seep into buildings from rocks underground. Exposure to radon gas may cause lung cancer. Another potential poison in indoor air is carbon monoxide. It may be released by faulty or poorly vented furnaces or other fuel-burning appliances. Indoor furniture, carpets, and paints may release toxic compounds into the air as well. Other possible sources of indoor air pollution include dust, mold, and pet dander."}
{"prompt":"Question: Who invented the taxonomic classification system?\nOptions:\n A. Pascal\nB. gregor mendel\nC. Isaac Newton\nD. carl linnaeus","completion":"carl linnaeus\nExplanation: The Levels of Classification Taxonomy (which literally means \u201carrangement law\u201d) is the science of naming and grouping species to construct an internationally shared classification system. The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist) uses a hierarchical model. A hierarchical system has levels and each group at one of the levels includes groups at the next lowest level, so that at the lowest level each member belongs to a series of nested groups. An analogy is the nested series of directories on the main disk drive of a computer. For example, in the most inclusive grouping, scientists divide organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second level called a kingdom. Each domain contains several kingdoms. Within kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. As an example, the classification levels for the domestic dog are shown in Figure 12.3. The group at each level is called a taxon (plural: taxa). In other words, for the dog, Carnivora is the taxon at the order level, Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, such as domestic dog, or wolf. Each taxon name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized. Scientists refer to an organism by its genus and species names together, commonly called a scientific name, or Latin name. This two-name system is called binomial nomenclature. The scientific name of the wolf is therefore Canis lupus. Recent study of the DNA of domestic."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the change of characteristics of living things over time?\nOptions:\n A. spontaneous mutation\nB. adaptation\nC. generation\nD. evolution","completion":"evolution\nExplanation: Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection , some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth."}
{"prompt":"Question: The \u201cknee-jerk\" motion that people involuntarily perform after being struck in the knee in a certain way is an example of what kind of behavior?\nOptions:\n A. reaction\nB. spasm\nC. sensor\nD. reflex","completion":"reflex\nExplanation: Innate Behaviors: Movement and Migration Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli. The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus. To test the \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer. The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great capacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the name for the process of charging an object by touching it with another charged object?\nOptions:\n A. charging by conduction\nB. charging by connection\nC. charging by convection\nD. charging by transfer","completion":"charging by conduction\nExplanation: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge."}

{"prompt":"Question: Nonshivering thermogenesis, which involves the breakdown of brown adipose tissue, is a special methods newborns have for what purpose?\nOptions:\n A. losing heat\nB. harnessing heat\nC. generating heat\nD. moving heat","completion":"generating heat\nExplanation: Thermoregulatory Adjustments The fetus floats in warm amniotic fluid that is maintained at a temperature of approximately 98.6\u00b0F with very little fluctuation. Birth exposes newborns to a cooler environment in which they have to regulate their own body temperature. Newborns have a higher ratio of surface area to volume than adults. This means that their body has less volume throughout which to produce heat, and more surface area from which to lose heat. As a result, newborns produce heat more slowly and lose it more quickly. Newborns also have immature musculature that limits their ability to generate heat by shivering. Moreover, their nervous systems are underdeveloped, so they cannot quickly constrict superficial blood vessels in response to cold. They also have little subcutaneous fat for insulation. All these factors make it harder for newborns to maintain their body temperature. Newborns, however, do have a special method for generating heat: nonshivering thermogenesis, which involves the breakdown of brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, which is distributed over the back, chest, and shoulders. Brown fat differs from the more familiar white fat in two ways: \u2022 It is highly vascularized. This allows for faster delivery of oxygen, which leads to faster cellular respiration. \u2022 It is packed with a special type of mitochondria that are able to engage in cellular respiration reactions that produce less ATP and more heat than standard cellular respiration reactions."}

Water is one liquid that displays this property."}
{"prompt":"Question: Active and passive forms of what enable the body to resist damage from pathogens?\nOptions:\n A. potential\nB. stem cells\nC. autonomy\nD. immunity","completion":"immunity\nExplanation: Active versus Passive Immunity Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one. Both active and passive immunity have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine. Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual (Table 21.6). Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter. Artificially acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological memory. The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough."}

Bacteria reproduce through binary fission , where they grow and divide in half ( Figure below ). First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly."}
{"prompt":"Question: What types of stimuli control endocrine activity?\nOptions:\n A. light and pressure\nB. chemical and neural\nC. temperature and light\nD. pressure and chemical","completion":"chemical and neural\nExplanation: Role of Endocrine Gland Stimuli Reflexes triggered by both chemical and neural stimuli control endocrine activity. These reflexes may be simple, involving only one hormone response, or they may be more complex and involve many hormones, as is the case with the hypothalamic control of various anterior pituitary\u2013controlled hormones. Humoral stimuli are changes in blood levels of non-hormone chemicals, such as nutrients or ions, which cause the release or inhibition of a hormone to, in turn, maintain homeostasis. For example, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect changes in blood osmolarity (the concentration of solutes in the blood plasma). If blood osmolarity is too high, meaning that the blood is not dilute enough, osmoreceptors signal the hypothalamus to release ADH. The hormone causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water and reduce the volume of urine produced. This reabsorption causes a reduction of the osmolarity of the blood, diluting the blood to the appropriate level. The regulation of blood glucose is another example. High blood glucose levels cause the release of insulin from the pancreas, which increases glucose uptake by cells and liver storage of glucose as glycogen. An endocrine gland may also secrete a hormone in response to the presence of another hormone produced by a different endocrine gland. Such hormonal stimuli often involve the hypothalamus, which produces releasing and inhibiting hormones that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones. In addition to these chemical signals, hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli. A common example of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system. When an individual perceives danger, sympathetic neurons signal the adrenal glands to secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine. The two."}

{"prompt":"Question: In mammals, what layer protects the egg?\nOptions:\n A. Choloza\nB. Germinal Disc\nC. Albumen\nD. zona pellucida","completion":"zona pellucida\nExplanation: Early Embryonic Development Fertilization is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote (Figure 18.8). To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, a layer called the zona pellucida protects the egg. At the tip of the head of a sperm cell is a structure like a lysosome called the acrosome, which contains enzymes. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. These reactions, involving enzymes from the acrosome, allow the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane and permit the sperm nucleus to transfer into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus or genome."}

{"prompt":"Question: When atoms gain or lose electrons, what is formed?\nOptions:\n A. ions\nB. crystals\nC. molecules\nD. gas","completion":"ions\nExplanation: As we saw in the previous chapter, ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. If an atom loses one or more electrons, the resulting ion has a positive charge (more protons are present than electrons). If the atom gains one or more electrons, the resulting ion has a negative charge (more electrons are present than protons). Positive ions are called cations, and negative ions are called anions. Because opposite charges attract one another, cations and anions are held together by strong electromagnetic forces. An ionic compound consists of a large three-dimensional array of alternating cations and anions. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) is composed of Na + and Cl - ions arranged into a structure like the one shown in Figure below ."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where are most chloroplasts found in plants?\nOptions:\n A. roots\nB. stems\nC. flowers\nD. leaves","completion":"leaves\nExplanation: In plants, most chloroplasts are found in the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials needed for photosynthesis must be present in the leaves. These materials include light, water, and carbon dioxide. The shape of the leaves gives them a lot of surface area to absorb light for photosynthesis. Roots take up water from the soil. Stems carry the water from the roots to the leaves. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through tiny openings called stomata. (The oxygen released during photosynthesis also exits the leaves through the stomata. )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What layered form of carbon is used as a lubricant and in pencils?\nOptions:\n A. carbonite\nB. copper\nC. lead\nD. graphite","completion":"graphite\nExplanation: Graphite is a form of carbon in which carbon atoms are arranged in layers. Bonds are strong between carbon atoms within each layer but relatively weak between atoms in different layers. The weak bonds between layers allow the layers to slide over one another. This makes graphite relatively soft and slippery. It is used as a lubricant. It also makes up the \"lead\" in pencils."}

{"prompt":"Question: The normal respiratory rate per minute in adult humans is?\nOptions:\n A. 6-12 breaths\nB. 0-6 breaths\nC. 18-24 breaths\nD. 12-18 breaths","completion":"12-18 breaths\nExplanation: Respiratory Rate and Control of Ventilation Breathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can consciously control it, such as when you swim under water, sing a song, or blow bubbles. The respiratory rate is the total number of breaths, or respiratory cycles, that occur each minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease, as the rate may increase or decrease during an illness or in a disease condition. The respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center located within the medulla oblongata in the brain, which responds primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the blood. The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year of age has a normal respiratory rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about 10 years old, the normal rate is closer to 18 to 30. By adolescence, the normal respiratory rate is similar to that of adults, 12 to 18 breaths per minute."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the nonliving aspects of the environment called?\nOptions:\n A. metastatic factors\nB. nucleic factors\nC. abiotic factors\nD. antibiotic factors","completion":"abiotic factors\nExplanation: Abiotic factors are the nonliving aspects of the environment.

{"prompt":"Question: The brain is said to contain gray matter, while what related structure contains white matter separated into columns?\nOptions:\n A. spinal cord\nB. brain stem\nC. amygdala\nD. orbital lobe","completion":"spinal cord\nExplanation: White Columns Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns. Between the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior columns. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons, are the lateral columns. The posterior columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and lateral columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tracts\u2014the latter carrying motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are responsible for removing excess h+ ions from the blood?\nOptions:\n A. kidneys\nB. liver nodes\nC. intestinal walls\nD. stomach chambers","completion":"kidneys\nExplanation: The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen to blood pH and to hemoglobin affinity for oxygen? Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to P O , 2 other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery. Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20). When carbon + dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO\u2212 3 ) and hydrogen ions (H ). As the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced. Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygencarrying capacity. In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 39.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This is painful when it occurs. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb. Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for  interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations?\nOptions:\n A. symbiotic relationships\nB. parasitic relationships\nC. cooperative evolution\nD. food chain","completion":"symbiotic relationships\nExplanation: Symbiosis Symbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. Most scientists accept this definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the interaction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used. Commensalism A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither benefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 45.25). The tree is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are unaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators. Another example of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone. The sea anemone is not harmed by the fish, and the fish benefits with protection from predators who would be stung upon nearing the sea anemone."}
{"prompt":"Question: When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, what do they form?\nOptions:\n A. organs\nB. Brian\nC. produce\nD. organ","completion":"organ\nExplanation: Plant Organ Systems In plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (nonreproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. Figure 30.2 shows the organ systems of a typical plant."}

{"prompt":"Question: For fertilization to occur in angiosperms, pollen has to be transferred to the stigma of what?\nOptions:\n A. flower\nB. stem\nC. leaf\nD. root","completion":"flower\nExplanation: 32.2 Pollination and Fertilization For fertilization to occur in angiosperms, pollen has to be transferred to the stigma of a flower: a process known as pollination. Gymnosperm pollination involves the transfer of pollen from a male cone to a female cone. When the pollen of the flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower, it is called self-pollination. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from one flower to another flower on the same plant, or another plant. Cross-pollination requires pollinating agents such as water, wind, or animals, and increases genetic diversity. After the pollen lands on the stigma, the tube cell gives rise to the pollen tube, through which the generative nucleus migrates. The pollen tube gains entry through the micropyle on the ovule sac. The generative cell divides to form two sperm cells: one fuses with the egg to form the diploid zygote, and the other fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm, which is triploid in nature. This is known as double fertilization. After fertilization, the zygote divides to form the embryo and the fertilized ovule forms the seed. The walls of the ovary form the fruit in which the seeds develop. The seed, when mature, will germinate under favorable conditions and give rise to the diploid sporophyte."}
{"prompt":"Question: Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their what?\nOptions:\n A. ancestors\nB. skeletons\nC. excretions\nD. blood","completion":"excretions\nExplanation: The Phosphorus Cycle Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acids and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic, particularly freshwater, ecosystems. Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43-). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of Earth\u2019s surface. (Figure 20.13) Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine organisms. The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years."}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is the pituitary gland?\nOptions:\n A. thyroid\nB. heart\nC. lung\nD. brain","completion":"brain\nExplanation: The regulation of Leydig cell production of testosterone begins outside of the testes. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain integrate external and internal signals to control testosterone synthesis and secretion. The regulation begins in the hypothalamus. Pulsatile release of a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the endocrine release of hormones from the pituitary gland. Binding of GnRH to its receptors on the anterior pituitary gland stimulates release of the two gonadotropins: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These two hormones are critical for reproductive function in both men and women. In men, FSH binds predominantly to the Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules to promote spermatogenesis. FSH also stimulates the Sertoli cells to produce hormones called inhibins, which function to inhibit FSH release from the pituitary, thus reducing testosterone secretion. These polypeptide hormones correlate directly with Sertoli cell function and sperm number; inhibin B can be used as a marker of spermatogenic activity. In men, LH binds to receptors on Leydig cells in the testes and upregulates the production of testosterone. A negative feedback loop predominantly controls the synthesis and secretion of both FSH and LH. Low blood concentrations of testosterone stimulate the hypothalamic release of GnRH. GnRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete LH into the bloodstream. In the testis, LH binds to LH receptors on Leydig cells and stimulates the release of testosterone. When concentrations of testosterone in the blood reach a critical threshold, testosterone itself will bind to androgen receptors on both the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of GnRH and LH, respectively. When the blood concentrations of testosterone once again decline, testosterone no longer interacts with the receptors to the same degree and GnRH and LH are once again secreted, stimulating more testosterone production. This same process occurs with FSH and inhibin to control spermatogenesis."}

{"prompt":"Question: A type of what organism causes ergot, a disease that impacts crops directly and has more devastating effects on animals?\nOptions:\n A. insects\nB. bacteria\nC. fungus\nD. virus","completion":"fungus\nExplanation: Plant Parasites and Pathogens The production of enough good-quality crops is essential to our existence. Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. Most plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (Figure 13.25). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot\u2019s alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance: In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops."}

{"prompt":"Question: Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from where?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. anus\nC. uterus\nD. tumors","completion":"uterus\nExplanation: Visit this website (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/embryo_fetus2) to see the stages of human fetal development. Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from the uterus. Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force. There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor."}
{"prompt":"Question: Mammoths, close genetic relatives of modern elephants, are believed to have gone extinct due to hunting by humans and what factor?\nOptions:\n A. volcanic eruptions\nB. earthquakes\nC. climate change\nD. migration change","completion":"climate change\nExplanation: It's easy to get lost in the discussion of dinosaurs and theories about why they went extinct 65 million years ago. Was it due to a meteor slamming into Earth near the coast of modern-day Mexico, or was it from some long-term weather cycle that is not yet understood? One hypothesis that will never be proposed is that humans had something to do with it. Mammals were small, insignificant creatures of the forest 65 million years ago, and no humans existed. Woolly mammoths, however, began to go extinct about 10,000 years ago, when they shared the Earth with humans who were no different anatomically than humans today (Figure 45.12). Mammoths survived in isolated island populations as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the ice of Siberia and other regions of the north. Scientists have sequenced at least 50 percent of its genome and believe mammoths are between 98 and 99 percent identical to modern elephants. It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth\u2019s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years [7] ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago. It is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively responsible for the extinction of these [8] magnificent creatures. In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of habitat, these scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of humans across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature. Once we contributed to a species\u2019 decline using primitive hunting technology only."}

At least two elements must change their oxidation numbers. When an oxidation number of an atom is increased in the course of a redox reaction, that atom is being oxidized. When an oxidation number of an atom is decreased in the course of a redox reaction, that atom is being reduced. Thus oxidation and reduction can also be defined in terms of increasing or decreasing oxidation numbers, respectively. Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: What phase exists when all the water in a container has physical properties intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states?\nOptions:\n A. supercritical fluid\nB. stationary fluid\nC. hydrothermal fluid\nD. impregnation fluid","completion":"supercritical fluid\nExplanation: Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 \u00b0C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 \u00b0C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance."}
{"prompt":"Question: Many objects have color because they contain what?\nOptions:\n A. pigments\nB. solvents\nC. vitamins\nD. salts","completion":"pigments\nExplanation: Many objects have color because they contain pigments. A pigment is a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common pigment is the dark green pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in plants. Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light. Pigments are also found in many manufactured products. They are used to color paints, inks, and dyes. Just three pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary colors of pigments are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow."}

{"prompt":"Question: What has a bigger impact on water quality, natural events or human activity?\nOptions:\n A. water quality\nB. all of the above\nC. human activity\nD. natural events","completion":"human activity\nExplanation: Natural events, like storms, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality. But human-caused contaminants have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply. Water is considered polluted either when it does not support a human use, like clean drinking water, or a use for other animals and plants. The overgrowth of algae, known as an algal bloom , can result from the runoff of fertilizer into bodies of water. This excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control, bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the process of processing used material into new ones called?\nOptions:\n A. remake\nB. renew\nC. reuse\nD. recycling","completion":"recycling\nExplanation: Now we move on to recycle. Sometimes it may be difficult to understand the differences between reusing and recycling. Recycling involves processing used materials in order to make them suitable for other uses. That usually means taking a used item, breaking it down, and reusing the pieces. Even though recycling requires extra energy, it does often make use of items which are broken, worn out, or cannot be reused."}
{"prompt":"Question: Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions with a positive charge have lost what?\nOptions:\n A. proton\nB. electron\nC. neutron\nD. atom","completion":"electron\nExplanation: Solution First, write out the electron configuration for each parent atom. We have chosen to show the full, unabbreviated configurations to provide more practice for students who want it, but listing the coreabbreviated electron configurations is also acceptable. Next, determine whether an electron is gained or lost. Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions with a positive charge have lost an electron. For main group elements, the last orbital gains or loses the electron. For transition metals, the last s orbital loses an electron before the d orbitals. (a) Na: 1s22s22p63s1. Sodium cation loses one electron, so Na+: 1s22s22p63s1 = Na+: 1s22s22p6. (b) P: 1s22s22p63s23p3. Phosphorus trianion gains three electrons, so P3\u2212: 1s22s22p63s23p6. (c) Al: 1s22s22p63s23p1. Aluminum dication loses two electrons Al2+: 1s22s22p63s23p1 = Al2+: 1s22s22p63s1. (d) Fe: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d6. Iron(II) loses two electrons and, since it is a transition metal, they are removed from the 4s orbital Fe2+: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d6 = 1s22s22p63s23p63d6. Sm: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f6. Samarium trication loses three electrons. The first two will be lost from the 6s orbital, and the final one is removed from the 4f orbital. Sm3+: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f6 = 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p64f5."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is another environmental benefit of conserving resources?\nOptions:\n A. less trash\nB. more jobs\nC. warmer temperatures\nD. lower prices","completion":"less trash\nExplanation: When we conserve resources, we also cut down on the trash we produce. Americans throw out 340 million tons of trash each year. We throw out 2.5 million plastic bottles alone\u2014every hour! Most of what we throw out ends up in landfills ( Figure below ). In a landfill, all those plastic bottles take hundreds of years to break down. What are the problems caused by producing so much trash? Natural resources must be used to produce the materials. Land must be given over to dump the materials. If the materials are toxic, they may cause pollution."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are cyclins made up of?\nOptions:\n A. group of proteins\nB. enzymes\nC. group of sugars\nD. steroids","completion":"group of proteins\nExplanation: The cell cycle is controlled by a number of protein-controlled feedback processes. Two types of proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle are kinases and cyclins . Cyclins activate kinases by binding to them, specifically they activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) . Cyclins comprise a group of proteins that are rapidly produced at key stages in the cell cycle. Once activated by a cyclin, CDK are enzymes that activate or inactivate other target molecules through phosphorylation. It is this precise regulation of proteins that triggers advancement through the cell cycle. Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these critical proteins."}
{"prompt":"Question: The most common elements have the most tightly bound __________.\nOptions:\n A. quarks\nB. membrane\nC. atoms\nD. nuclei","completion":"nuclei\nExplanation: There are some noticeable spikes on the BE \/ A graph, which represent particularly tightly bound nuclei. These spikes reveal further details of nuclear forces, such as confirming that closed-shell nuclei (those with magic numbers of protons or neutrons or both) are more tightly bound. The spikes also indicate that some nuclei with even numbers for Z and N , and with Z = N , are exceptionally tightly bound. This finding can be correlated with some of the cosmic abundances of the elements. The most common elements in the universe, as determined by observations of atomic spectra from outer space, are hydrogen, followed by 4 He , with much smaller amounts of 12 C and other elements. It should be noted that the heavier elements are created in supernova explosions, while the lighter ones are produced by nuclear fusion during the normal life cycles of stars, as will be discussed in subsequent chapters. The most common elements have the most tightly bound nuclei. It is also no accident that one of the most tightly bound light nuclei is 4 He , emitted in \u03b1 decay."}

A disease that is not contagious is called a noninfectious disease. These diseases are not caused by pathogens. Instead, they are likely to have causes such as lifestyle factors, environmental toxins, or gene mutations. Common types of noninfectious diseases include cancer, diabetes, and immune system diseases."}
{"prompt":"Question: What body joint incurs the most common overuse injury among runners and other athletes?\nOptions:\n A. arm\nB. knee\nC. heel\nD. ankle","completion":"knee\nExplanation: Runner\u2019s Knee Runner\u2019s knee, also known as patellofemoral syndrome, is the most common overuse injury among runners. It is most frequent in adolescents and young adults, and is more common in females. It often results from excessive running, particularly downhill, but may also occur in athletes who do a lot of knee bending, such as jumpers, skiers, cyclists, weight lifters, and soccer players. It is felt as a dull, aching pain around the front of the knee and deep to the patella. The pain may be felt when walking or running, going up or down stairs, kneeling or squatting, or after sitting with the knee bent for an extended period. Patellofemoral syndrome may be initiated by a variety of causes, including individual variations in the shape and movement of the patella, a direct blow to the patella, or flat feet or improper shoes that cause excessive turning in or out of the feet or leg. These factors may cause in an imbalance in the muscle pull that acts on the patella, resulting in an abnormal tracking of the patella that allows it to deviate too far toward the lateral side of the patellar surface on the distal femur. Because the hips are wider than the knee region, the femur has a diagonal orientation within the thigh, in contrast to the vertically oriented tibia of the leg (Figure 8.17). The Q-angle is a measure of how far the femur is angled laterally away from vertical. The Q-angle is normally 10\u201315 degrees, with females typically having a larger Q-angle due to their wider pelvis. During extension of the knee, the quadriceps femoris muscle pulls the patella both superiorly and laterally, with the lateral pull greater in women due to their large Q-angle. This makes women more vulnerable to developing patellofemoral syndrome than men. Normally, the large lip on the lateral side of the patellar surface of the femur compensates for the lateral pull on the patella, and thus helps to maintain its proper tracking. However, if the pull produced by the medial and lateral sides of the quadriceps femoris muscle is not properly balanced, abnormal tracking of the patella toward the lateral side may occur. With continued use, this produces pain and could result in damage to the articulating surfaces of the patella and femur, and the possible future development of arthritis. Treatment generally involves stopping the activity that produces knee pain for a period of time, followed by a gradual resumption of activity. Proper strengthening of the quadriceps femoris muscle to correct for imbalances is also important to help prevent reoccurrence."}
{"prompt":"Question: A comet striking the earth may have caused mass extinction, this would have decreased sunlight, which would have effected what plant process reducing food?\nOptions:\n A. photosynthesis\nB. fertilization\nC. decomposition\nD. glycolysis","completion":"photosynthesis\nExplanation: At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does magma that cools underground form?\nOptions:\n A. anomalies\nB. intrusions\nC. plates\nD. cracks","completion":"intrusions\nExplanation: Magma that cools underground forms intrusions ( Figure below ). Usually this magma is very viscous felsic magma. This magma does not rise easily and so cools slowly underground. Intrusions become land formations if they are exposed at the surface by uplift and erosion."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material?\nOptions:\n A. the complex envelope\nB. the cell wall\nC. the nuclear envelope\nD. the nuclear compression","completion":"the nuclear envelope\nExplanation: The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material. It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two phospholipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm."}
{"prompt":"Question: The fossilized skeleton of archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur, but it had what structures modified for flight, a trait associated only with birds among modern animals?\nOptions:\n A. fingers\nB. claws\nC. feathers\nD. beaks","completion":"feathers\nExplanation: fossils and birds, specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones, as well as the presence of the wishbone, formed by the fusing of the clavicles. One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx, which is from the Jurassic period (Figure 29.33). Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, because it is an intermediate fossil, meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds. Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird, but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur. The fossilized skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur, and it had teeth whereas birds do not, but it also had feathers modified for flight, a trait associated only with birds among modern animals. Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist, but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which infection turns ant's abdomen red and fruit-like and an easy prey for birds?\nOptions:\n A. neotropicum\nB. yeast\nC. trichina\nD. cocklebur","completion":"neotropicum\nExplanation: neotropicum infects the ant Cephalotes atratus, leading to dramatic changes in the infected ant's morphology and behavior. The infected ant\u2019s abdomen turns red and is held raised up, which makes it resemble a fruit and increases the likelihood of the infected ant being eaten by birds (\u2192). The birds transport the worms, which survive in their digestive systems until they are excreted; they are then eaten by, and infect new ants to complete the worm\u2019s life cycle.78 Perhaps the most famous example of this type of behavior occurs in wasps of the family Ichneumonidae. Female wasps deposit their fertilized eggs into the bodies of various types of caterpillars. The wasp eggs hatch out and produce larvae which then feed on the living caterpillar, consuming it from the inside out. Charles Darwin, in a letter to the American naturalist Asa Gray, remarked \u201cThere seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. \u201d Rather than presume that a supernatural creator was responsible for such apparently cruel behaviors, Darwin and others sought alternative, morally neutral naturalistic processes that could both generate biological diversity and explain biological behaviors. As the diversity of organisms became increasingly apparent and difficult to ignore, another broad and inescapable conclusion began to emerge from anatomical studies: many different organisms displayed remarkable structural similarities. For example, as naturalists characterized various types of animals, they found that they either had an internal skeleton (the vertebrates) or did not (the invertebrates). Comparative studies revealed that there were often many similarities between quite different types of organisms. A classic work, published in 1555, compared the skeletons of a human and a bird, both vertebrates.79 While many bones have different shape and relative sizes, what was most striking is how many bones are at least superficially similar between the two organisms (\u2192). This type of \u201ccomparative anatomy\u201d revealed many similarities between apparently unrelated organisms. For example, the skeleton of the dugong (a large aquatic mammal) appears quite similar to that of the European mole, a small terrestrial mammal that tunnels underground on land. In fact, there are general skeletal similarities between all vertebrates. The closer we look, the more similarities we find. These similarities run deeper than the."}

{"prompt":"Question: What performance-enhancing drugs are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone, testosterone?\nOptions:\n A. anabolic steroids\nB. catabolic steroids\nC. progesterone\nD. estrogen","completion":"anabolic steroids\nExplanation: Anabolic Steroids The endocrine system can be exploited for illegal or unethical purposes. A prominent example of this is the use of steroid drugs by professional athletes. Commonly used for performance enhancement, anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone, testosterone. By boosting natural levels of this hormone, athletes experience increased muscle mass. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass. The use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations in the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them. In addition, the drugs can cause significant and dangerous side effects. For example, anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol levels, raise blood pressure, and damage the liver. Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have been implicated in causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Paradoxically, steroids can have a feminizing effect in males, including shriveled testicles and enlarged breast tissue. In females, their use can cause masculinizing effects such as an enlarged clitoris and growth of facial hair. In both sexes, their use can promote increased aggression (commonly known as \u201croid-rage\u201d), depression, sleep disturbances, severe acne, and infertility."}

{"prompt":"Question: Of the four main wobble base pairs, guanine is paired with what?\nOptions:\n A. thymine\nB. cytosine\nC. adenine\nD. uracil","completion":"uracil\nExplanation: A wobble base pair is a non-Watson Crick base pairing between two nucleotides in RNA molecules. The four main wobble base pairs are guanine-uracil, inocine-uracil, inosine-adenine, and inosine-cytosine. Wobble base pairs are fundamental in RNA secondary structure and are critical for the proper translation of the genetic code. Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed from the hydrolytic deamination of adenine. Structurally, it resembles guanine, but lacks the 2-amino group. This lack of the 2-amino group allows inosine to form base pairs with uracil, cytosine and adenine, making it a particularly wobbly base."}

{"prompt":"Question: Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than this?\nOptions:\n A. vitamins\nB. electrolytes\nC. minerals\nD. carbohydrates","completion":"carbohydrates\nExplanation: 24.7 Nutrition and Diet Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. More energy is required to break down fats and proteins than carbohydrates; however, all excess calories that are ingested will be stored as fat in the body. On average, a person requires 1500 to 2000 calories for normal daily activity, although routine exercise will increase that amount. If you ingest more than that, the remainder is stored for later use. Conversely, if you ingest less than that, the energy stores in your body will be depleted. Both the quantity and quality of the food you eat affect your metabolism and can affect your overall health. Eating too much or too little can result in serious medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Vitamins and minerals are essential parts of the diet. They are needed for the proper function of metabolic pathways in the body. Vitamins are not stored in the body, so they must be obtained from the diet or synthesized from precursors available in the diet. Minerals are also obtained from the diet, but they are also stored, primarily in skeletal tissues."}

{"prompt":"Question: Along with nerve tissue, what kind of tissue are lecithins and cephalins important constituents of?\nOptions:\n A. heart tissue\nB. brain tissue\nC. lung tissue\nD. skin tissue","completion":"brain tissue\nExplanation: (a) Amino alcohols are commonly found in phosphoglycerides, which are evident in its structural formula (b). There are two common types of phosphoglycerides. Phosphoglycerides containing ethanolamine as the amino alcohol are called phosphatidylethanolamines orcephalins. Cephalins are found in brain tissue and nerves and also have a role in blood clotting. Phosphoglycerides containing choline as the amino alcohol unit are called phosphatidylcholines or lecithins. Lecithins occur in all living organisms. Like cephalins, they are important constituents of nerve and brain tissue. Egg yolks are especially rich in lecithins. Commercial-grade lecithins isolated from soybeans are widely used in foods as emulsifying agents. An emulsifying agent is used to stabilize an emulsion\u2014a dispersion of two liquids that do not normally mix, such as oil and water. Many foods are emulsions. Milk is an emulsion of butterfat in water. The emulsifying agent in milk is a protein called casein. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of salad oil in water, stabilized by lecithins present in egg yolk.

{"prompt":"Question: The study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter is what?\nOptions:\n A. geology\nB. thermodynamics\nC. biochemistry\nD. nuclear energy","completion":"thermodynamics\nExplanation: Energy Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter relevant to a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. In an open system, energy can be exchanged with its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost to the air. A closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings. Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as they use energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to physical laws. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe. In general, energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change. Energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. To appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand two of the physical laws that govern energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: Ionic liquids heating a salt to its melting point produces a what?\nOptions:\n A. table salt\nB. molten salt\nC. plasma\nD. gas","completion":"molten salt\nExplanation: Molten Salts and Ionic Liquids Heating a salt to its melting point produces a molten salt. If we heated a sample of solid NaCl to its melting point of 801\u00b0C, for example, it would melt to give a stable liquid that conducts electricity. The characteristics of molten salts other than electrical conductivity are their high heat capacity, ability to attain very high temperatures (over 700\u00b0C) as a liquid, and utility as solvents because of their relatively low toxicity. Molten salts have many uses in industry and the laboratory. For example, in solar power towers in the desert of California, mirrors collect and focus sunlight to melt a mixture of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate. The heat stored in the molten salt is used to produce steam that drives a steam turbine and a generator, thereby producing electricity from the sun for southern California. Due to their low toxicity and high thermal efficiency, molten salts have also been used in nuclear reactors to enable operation at temperatures greater than 750\u00b0C. One prototype reactor tested in the 1950s used a fuel and a coolant consisting of molten fluoride salts, including NaF, ZrF 4, and UF4. Molten salts are also."}

In a fuel cell, energy is not stored; electrical energy is provided by a chemical reaction."}
{"prompt":"Question: Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main sources - sexual reproduction and what else?\nOptions:\n A. radiation\nB. education\nC. mutation\nD. pathogen","completion":"mutation\nExplanation: Variation and Adaptation Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons, such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes. Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main sources: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles or new genetic variation in any population. An individual that has a mutated gene might have a different trait than other individuals in the population. However, this is not always the case. A mutation can have one of three outcomes on the organisms\u2019 appearance (or phenotype):."}

{"prompt":"Question: In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and what?\nOptions:\n A. trees\nB. pathogens\nC. bacteria\nD. lizards","completion":"bacteria\nExplanation: Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains\u2014Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (Figure 1.17). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape). Woese\u2019s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese\u2019s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is light with wavelengths shorter than visible light called?\nOptions:\n A. weathering light\nB. infrared light\nC. radio waves\nD. ultraviolet light","completion":"ultraviolet light\nExplanation: Light with wavelengths shorter than visible light is called ultraviolet light . The term ultraviolet means \u201cabove violet. \u201d Ultraviolet light is the range of light waves that have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than violet light in the visible range of light. With higher frequencies than visible light, ultraviolet light has more energy. It can be used to kill bacteria in food and to sterilize surgical instruments. The human skin also makes vitamin D when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. Vitamin D, in turn, is needed for strong bones and teeth.

{"prompt":"Question: What happens to the temperature of a system during phase change?\nOptions:\n A. increases\nB. fluctuates rapidly\nC. remains constant\nD. decreases","completion":"remains constant\nExplanation: This plot of temperature shows what happens to a 75 g sample of ice initially at 1 atm and \u221223\u00b0C as heat is added at a constant rate: A\u2013B: heating solid ice; B\u2013C: melting ice; C\u2013D: heating liquid water; D\u2013 E: vaporizing water; E\u2013F: heating steam. Thus the temperature of a system does not change during a phase change. In this example, as long as even a tiny amount of ice is present, the temperature of the system remains at 0\u00b0C during the melting process, and as long as even a small amount of liquid water is present, the temperature of the system remains at 100\u00b0C during the boiling process. The rate at which heat is added does not affect the temperature of the ice\/water or water\/steam mixture because the added heat is being used exclusively to overcome the attractive forces that hold the more condensed phase together. Many cooks think that food will cook faster if the heat is turned up higher so that the water boils more rapidly. Instead, the pot of water will boil to dryness sooner, but the temperature of the water does not depend on how vigorously it boils."}
{"prompt":"Question: What single-celled organism can be either a predator, decomposer, herbivore, or parasite in the food chain?\nOptions:\n A. vertebrates\nB. protozoa\nC. mites\nD. Diatoms","completion":"protozoa\nExplanation: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms."}

{"prompt":"Question: Hydrocarbons in which all carbons are connected by single bonds are called?\nOptions:\n A. acids\nB. enzymes\nC. lipids\nD. alkanes","completion":"alkanes\nExplanation: Hydrocarbons are molecules that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Because each carbon atom can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, very large and complex molecules can be formed just from these two elements. Hydrocarbons in which all carbons are connected by single bonds are known as alkanes . If a C=C double bond is present, the compound is now an alkene . A triple bond between two carbons (C\u2261C) makes the compound an alkyne . Hydrocarbons can also be broadly classified as either saturated , which means they contain no multiple bonds, or unsaturated , which means they contain at least one double or triple bond."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter, consisting of a nucleus surrounded by electrons?\nOptions:\n A. atom\nB. proton\nC. molecule\nD. neutron","completion":"atom\nExplanation: Levels of Organization of Living Things Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large. The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.15), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms."}
{"prompt":"Question: This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called what?\nOptions:\n A. assimilation\nB. hybridization\nC. hydration\nD. activation","completion":"hybridization\nExplanation: Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, \u03c8, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5\u00b0). The observed angle of 104.5\u00b0 is experimental evidence for which quantummechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions. Note that orbitals may sometimes be drawn in an elongated \u201cballoon\u201d shape rather than in a more realistic \u201cplump\u201d shape in order to make the geometry easier to visualize."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs?\nOptions:\n A. sesamoid bones\nB. irregular bones\nC. flat bones\nD. short bones","completion":"flat bones\nExplanation: Flat Bones The term \u201c flat bone\u201d is somewhat of a misnomer because, although a flat bone is typically thin, it is also often curved. Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (breastbone), and the ribs. Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs."}
{"prompt":"Question: The smallest and lightest alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol) are completely soluble in?\nOptions:\n A. gasoline\nB. oil\nC. water\nD. argon","completion":"water\nExplanation: The smallest and lightest alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol) are completely soluble in water in all proportions. In a solution, the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other, resulting in complete miscibility. However, as the length of the carbon chain increases, the solubility decreases. The solubility of 1-butanol is 7.4 g per 100 g of water, while that of 1-pentanol is 2.7 g per 100 g water, and 1-octanol is 0.06 g per 100 g water. The carbon chain portion of the larger alcohol molecule is nonpolar and leads to the decreased solubility of the overall compound."}

{"prompt":"Question: Just as millions of different words are spelled with our 26-letter english alphabet, millions of different proteins are made with the 20 common what?\nOptions:\n A. mutation acids\nB. peptides\nC. amino acids\nD. enzymes","completion":"amino acids\nExplanation: Just as millions of different words are spelled with our 26-letter English alphabet, millions of different proteins are made with the 20 common amino acids. However, just as the English alphabet can be used to write gibberish, amino acids can be put together in the wrong sequence to produce nonfunctional proteins. Although the correct sequence is ordinarily of utmost importance, it is not always absolutely required. Just as you can sometimes make sense of incorrectly spelled English words, a protein with a small percentage of \u201cincorrect\u201d amino acids may continue to function. However, it rarely functions as well as a protein having the correct sequence. There are also instances in which seemingly minor errors of sequence have disastrous effects. For example, in some people, every molecule of hemoglobin (a protein in the blood that transports oxygen) has a single incorrect amino acid unit out of about 300 (a single valine replaces a glutamic acid). That \u201cminor\u201d error is responsible for sickle cell anemia, an inherited condition that usually is fatal."}

{"prompt":"Question: How many electrons are in the hydrogen atom?\nOptions:\n A. one\nB. five\nC. two\nD. three","completion":"one\nExplanation: For the hydrogen atom, there is no problem since there is only one electron in the H atom. However, when we get to helium we see that the first three quantum numbers for the two electrons are the same: same energy level, same spherical shape. What differentiates the two helium electrons is their spin. One of the electrons has spin while the other electron has spin. So the two electrons in the 1s orbital are each unique and distinct from one another because their spins are different. This observation leads to the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. The energy of the electron is specified by the principal, angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers. If those three numbers are identical for two electrons, the spin numbers must be different in order for the two electrons to be differentiated from one another. The two values of the spin quantum number allow each orbital to hold two electrons. The figure below shows how the electrons are indicated in a diagram."}

{"prompt":"Question: The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called what?\nOptions:\n A. proto-oncogenes\nB. stem cell genes\nC. primary genes\nD. ribosomes","completion":"proto-oncogenes\nExplanation: Proto-oncogenes The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle. The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle checkpoints. An oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which bonds are the strongest of the intermolecular forces?\nOptions:\n A. complex\nB. carbon\nC. hydrogen\nD. calcium","completion":"hydrogen\nExplanation: As a solid is heated, its particles vibrate more rapidly as the solid absorbs kinetic energy. Eventually, the organization of the particles within the solid structure begins to break down and the solid starts to melt. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid. At its melting point, the disruptive vibrations of the particles of the solid overcome the attractive forces operating within the solid. As with boiling points, the melting point of a solid is dependent on the strength of those attractive forces. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound that consists of a multitude of strong ionic bonds. Sodium chloride melts at 801\u00b0C. Ice (solid H 2 O) is a molecular compound whose molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds. Though hydrogen bonds are the strongest of the intermolecular forces, the strength of hydrogen bonds is much less than that of ionic bonds. The melting point of ice is 0\u00b0C."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a cellular \"scaffolding\" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm?\nOptions:\n A. protoskeleton\nB. cellulose\nC. cytoskeleton\nD. collagen","completion":"cytoskeleton\nExplanation: The cytoskeleton is a cellular \"scaffolding\" or \"skeleton\" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. All eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton, and recent research has shown that prokaryotic cells also have a cytoskeleton. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is made up of a network of long, thin protein fibers and has many functions. It helps to maintain cell shape. It holds organelles in place, and for some cells, it enables cell movement. The cytoskeleton also plays important roles in both the intracellular movement of substances and in cell division. Certain proteins act like a path that vesicles and organelles move along within the cell. The threadlike proteins that make up the cytoskeleton continually rebuild to adapt to the cell's constantly changing needs. Three main kinds of cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments."}

Aluminosilicates are formed by replacing some of the Si atoms in silicates by Al atoms; aluminosilicates with threedimensional framework structures are called zeolites. Nitrides formed by reacting silicon or germanium with nitrogen are strong, hard, and chemically inert. The hydrides become thermodynamically less stable down the group. Moreover, as atomic size increases, multiple bonds between or to the group 14 elements become weaker. Silicones, which contain an Si\u2013O backbone and Si\u2013C bonds, are high-molecular-mass polymers whose properties depend on their compositions."}
{"prompt":"Question: Stirring, surface area, and temperature affect the rate at which what occurs?\nOptions:\n A. solute dissolves\nB. concentration dissolves\nC. solute freezes\nD. solute fragments","completion":"solute dissolves\nExplanation: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don\u2019t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That\u2019s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs:."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of feeders are sea lilies and feather stars?\nOptions:\n A. deposit feeder\nB. bottom feeder\nC. silt feeders\nD. suspension feeders","completion":"suspension feeders\nExplanation: Explore the sea star\u2019s body plan (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/sea_star) up close, watch one move across the sea floor, and see it devour a mussel. Brittle stars belong to the class Ophiuroidea. Unlike sea stars, which have plump arms, brittle stars have long, thin arms that are sharply demarcated from the central disk. Brittle stars move by lashing out their arms or wrapping them around objects and pulling themselves forward. Sea urchins and sand dollars are examples of Echinoidea. These echinoderms do not have arms, but are hemispherical or flattened with five rows of tube feet that help them in slow movement; tube feet are extruded through pores of a continuous internal shell called a test. Sea lilies and feather stars are examples of Crinoidea. Both of these species are suspension feeders. Sea cucumbers of class Holothuroidea are extended in the oral-aboral axis and have five rows of tube feet. These are the only echinoderms that demonstrate \u201cfunctional\u201d bilateral symmetry as adults, because the uniquely extended oral-aboral axis compels the animal to lie horizontally rather than stand vertically."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the method of evolution by which advantageous heritable traits become more common over generations?\nOptions:\n A. artificial selection\nB. same selection\nC. flow selection\nD. natural selection","completion":"natural selection\nExplanation: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \"fit\" to survive in a particular environment and have \"adapted\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology."}
{"prompt":"Question: Higher pressures increase the solubility of what?\nOptions:\n A. molecules\nB. gases\nC. fuels\nD. bases","completion":"gases\nExplanation: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures."}

The mass number is an integer that is approximately equal to the numerical value of the atomic mass. Although the mass number is unitless, it is assigned units called atomic mass."}
{"prompt":"Question: Bacteria reproduce through what process?\nOptions:\n A. binary fusion\nB. tertiary fission\nC. binary fission\nD. residual fission","completion":"binary fission\nExplanation: Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission . During binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells. The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Binary fission can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can double their population in less than ten minutes! This process makes it possible for a tremendous bacterial colony to start from a single cell."}
{"prompt":"Question: Why must values of specific heat be looked up in tables?\nOptions:\n A. lack of formulas\nB. difficult to memorize\nC. difficult to calculate\nD. difficult to understand","completion":"difficult to calculate\nExplanation: Values of specific heat must generally be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. In general, the specific heat also depends on the temperature. Table 14.1 lists representative values of specific heat for various substances. Except for gases, the temperature and volume dependence of the specific heat of most substances is weak. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass and ten times that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of water the same amount as for glass and ten times as much heat to raise the temperature of water as for iron. In fact, water has one of the largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life on Earth."}

{"prompt":"Question: Light waves differ based on their frequency and what else?\nOptions:\n A. density\nB. amplitude\nC. weight\nD. voltage","completion":"amplitude\nExplanation: 36.5 Vision Vision is the only photo responsive sense. Visible light travels in waves and is a very small slice of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Light waves differ based on their frequency (wavelength = hue) and amplitude (intensity = brightness). In the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors (photoreceptors): cones and rods. Cones, which are the source of color vision, exist in three forms\u2014L, M, and S\u2014and they are differentially sensitive to different wavelengths. Cones are located in the retina, along with the dim-light, achromatic receptors (rods). Cones are found in the fovea, the central region of the retina, whereas rods are found in the peripheral regions of the retina. Visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves. Ganglion cells come in several versions. Some ganglion cell axons carry information on form, movement, depth, and brightness, while other axons carry information on color and fine detail. Visual information is sent to the superior colliculi in the midbrain, where coordination of eye movements and integration of auditory information takes place. Visual information is also sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which plays a role in the circadian cycle."}

{"prompt":"Question: What causes a small scrap of paper placed on top of the water droplet to float , although the object is denser (heavier) than the water?\nOptions:\n A. diffusion\nB. transfusion\nC. surface tension\nD. van der waals force","completion":"surface tension\nExplanation: a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet, although the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is created by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating on the top. It is even possible to \u201cfloat\u201d a steel needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently, without breaking the surface tension (Figure 2.11)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Which nerve directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions?\nOptions:\n A. glands nerve\nB. vagus nerve\nC. larynx nerve\nD. gland nerve","completion":"vagus nerve\nExplanation: Nerves of the Face and Oral Cavity An iconic part of a doctor\u2019s visit is the inspection of the oral cavity and pharynx, suggested by the directive to \u201copen your mouth and say \u2018ah. \u2019\u201d This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue depressor, of the back of the mouth, or the opening of the oral cavity into the pharynx known as the fauces. Whereas this portion of a medical exam inspects for signs of infection, such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of the cranial nerves that are associated with the oral cavity. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain. Testing this is as simple as introducing salty, sour, bitter, or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue. The patient should respond to the taste stimulus before retracting the tongue into the mouth. Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve into the saliva and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral deficits. Along with taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls. These sensations, along with certain taste stimuli, can stimulate the gag reflex. If the examiner moves the tongue depressor to contact the lateral wall of the fauces, this should elicit the gag reflex. Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an equivalent response. The motor response, through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx, is mediated through the vagus nerve. Normally, the vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature. The vagus nerve directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions. Further testing of vagus motor function has the patient repeating consonant sounds that require movement of the muscles around the fauces. The patient is asked to say \u201clah-kah-."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe the muscular canal (approximately 10 cm long) that serves as the entrance to the reproductive tract?\nOptions:\n A. uterus\nB. cervix\nC. vagina\nD. urethra","completion":"vagina\nExplanation: Vagina The vagina, shown at the bottom of Figure 27.9 and Figure 27.9, is a muscular canal (approximately 10 cm long) that serves as the entrance to the reproductive tract. It also serves as the exit from the uterus during menses and childbirth. The outer walls of the anterior and posterior vagina are formed into longitudinal columns, or ridges, and the superior portion of the vagina\u2014called the fornix\u2014meets the protruding uterine cervix. The walls of the vagina are lined with an outer, fibrous adventitia; a middle layer of smooth muscle; and an inner mucous membrane with transverse folds called rugae. Together, the middle and inner layers allow the expansion of the vagina to accommodate intercourse and childbirth. The thin, perforated hymen can partially surround the opening to the vaginal orifice. The hymen can be ruptured with strenuous physical exercise, penile\u2013vaginal intercourse, and childbirth. The Bartholin\u2019s glands and the lesser vestibular glands (located near the clitoris) secrete mucus, which keeps the vestibular area moist. The vagina is home to a normal population of microorganisms that help to protect against infection by pathogenic bacteria, yeast, or other organisms that can enter the vagina. In a healthy woman, the most predominant type of vaginal bacteria is from the genus Lactobacillus. This family of beneficial bacterial flora secretes lactic acid, and thus protects the vagina by maintaining an acidic pH (below 4.5). Potential pathogens are less likely to survive in these acidic conditions. Lactic acid, in combination with other vaginal secretions, makes the vagina a self-cleansing organ. However, douching\u2014or washing out the vagina with fluid\u2014can disrupt the normal balance of healthy microorganisms, and actually increase a woman\u2019s risk for infections and irritation. Indeed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that women do not douche, and that they allow the vagina to maintain its normal healthy population of protective microbial flora."}
{"prompt":"Question: What material is transported in a process called longshore drift?\nOptions:\n A. sediment\nB. boats\nC. foods\nD. grass","completion":"sediment\nExplanation: The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called longshore drift . Longshore drift is created in this way: Sediment is moved up the beach by an incoming wave. The wave approaches at an angle to the shore. Water then moves straight offshore. The sediment moves straight down the beach with it. The sediment is again picked up by a wave that is coming in at an angle. So longshore drift moves sediment along the shore. This zig-zag motion is pictured below ( Figure below ) and can also be seen at the link below."}

{"prompt":"Question: In physics, work means the use of what to move an object?\nOptions:\n A. mass\nB. energy\nC. force\nD. leverage","completion":"force\nExplanation: Work is defined differently in physics than in everyday language. In physics, work means the use of force to move an object. The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is studying isn\u2019t moving anything, so she isn\u2019t doing work. Not all force that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. The Figure below illustrates this point."}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the ultimate source of genetic variation?\nOptions:\n A. mutations\nB. parasites\nC. gravity\nD. proteins","completion":"mutations\nExplanation: Mutations and evolution There are often multiple alleles of a particular gene in the population and they all may be equally normal, that is have similar effects on reproductive success andin terms of the phenotypes they produce. If there is no significant selective advantage between them, their relative frequencies within a population will drift. At the same time, the phenotype associated with a particular allelecan be influenced by which alleles are present at other genetic loci, known as the genetic background. Since most traits are the results of hundreds or thousands of genes functioning together, and different combinations of alleles can produce different effects, the universe of variation is large. This can make identifying the genetic basis of a disease difficult, particularly when variation at any one locus may make only a minor contribution to the disease phenotype. On top of that, environmental and developmental differences can outweigh genetic influence on phenotype. Such genetic background effects can lead to a particular allele producing a disease in one person and not another.270 Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation \u2013 without them evolution would not occur. Mutations can lead to a number of effects, in particular, they can create new activities. At the same time these changes may reduce the original (and necessary) activity of an important gene. Left unresolved such molecular level conflicts would greatly limit the flexibility of evolutionary mechanisms. For example, it is common to think of a gene (or rather the particular gene product it encodes) as having one and only one function or activity, but in fact, when examined closely many catalytic gene products (typically proteins) can catalyze \u201coff-target\u201d reactions or carry out, even if rather inefficiently, other activities - they interact with other molecules within the cell and the organism. Assume for the moment that a gene encodes a gene product with an essential function as well as potentially useful (from a reproductive success perspective) activities. Mutations that enhance these \u201cancillary functions\u201d will survive (that is be passed on to subsequent generations) only to the extent that they do not (overly) negatively influence the gene\u2019s primary and essential function. The evolution of ancillary functions may be severely constrained or blocked altogether. This problem can be circumvented based on the fact that the genome is not static (\u2192). There are molecular level processes through 270."}

{"prompt":"Question: What can water's high surface tension be attributed t?\nOptions:\n A. territorial molecules sticking together\nB. polar molecules sticking together\nC. molecules create a thin film-like substance\nD. electric impulses in atoms","completion":"polar molecules sticking together\nExplanation: Water has remarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes, even though all other substances contract. This means that in the winter ice on a pond or lake will float. Water has high surface tension because polar molecules tend to stick together. That's why drops stick together or some bugs can walk on the surface of a pond. Without water, life might not be able to exist on Earth. If it did exist, it would not be as diverse or as complex."}
{"prompt":"Question: Over time, what changes solid rock into pieces?\nOptions:\n A. metamorphosis\nB. creep\nC. leaching\nD. weathering","completion":"weathering\nExplanation: Weathering changes solid rock into pieces. These pieces are called sediments. Sediments are described in the chapter Earth's Materials and Crust . Sediments are different sizes of rock particles. Boulders are sediments; so is gravel. At the other end, silt and clay are also sediments. Weathering may also cause the minerals at the Earth\u2019s surface to change form. The new minerals that form are stable at the Earth\u2019s surface. There are two types of weathering, mechanical and chemical. These are discussed in the next two concepts."}
{"prompt":"Question: Sympatric type of what occurs when a single population of organisms splits into two reproductively isolated communities within the same physical region?\nOptions:\n A. biodiversity\nB. speciation\nC. extraction\nD. accumulation","completion":"speciation\nExplanation: Sympatric speciation While the logic and mechanisms of allopatric speciation are relatively easy to grasp (we hope), there is a second type of speciation, known as sympatric speciation, which was originally more controversial. It occurs when a single population of organisms splits into two reproductively isolated communities within the same physical region. How could this possibly occur? What stop (or inhibits) the distinct sub-populations from inbreeding and reversing the effects of selection and nascent speciation? Recently a number of plausible mechanisms have been identified. One involves host selection.143\u00a0 In host selection, animals (such as insects) that feed off specific hosts may find themselves reproducing in distinct zones associated with their hosts. For example, organisms that prefer blueberries will mate in a different place, time of day, or time of year than those that prefer raspberries. There are blueberry- and raspberry-specific niches. Through a process of disruptive selection (see above), organisms that live primarily on a particular plant (or part of a plant) can be subject to different selective pressures, and reproductive isolation will enable the populations to more rapidly adapt. Mutations that reinforce an initial, perhaps weak, mating preference can lead reproductive isolation - this is a simple form of sexual selection (which we will discuss soon).144 One population has become two distinct, reproductively independent populations, one species has become two."}

{"prompt":"Question: In an atom, what two major types of particles are located in the nucleus?\nOptions:\n A. electrons and neutrons\nB. molecules and neutrons\nC. protons and neutrons\nD. ions and electrons","completion":"protons and neutrons\nExplanation: Rutherford\u2019s atomic model became known as the nuclear model . In the nuclear atom, the protons and neutrons, which comprise nearly all of the mass of the atom, are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom. The electrons are distributed around the nucleus and occupy most of the volume of the atom. It is worth emphasizing just how small the nucleus is compared to the rest of the atom. If we could blow up an atom to be the size of a large professional football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a marble."}

{"prompt":"Question: Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by which theory?\nOptions:\n A. Geiger theory\nB. molecular orbital theory\nC. string theory\nD. Pascal's theory","completion":"molecular orbital theory\nExplanation: Hybridization involves only \u03c3 bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of \u03c0 bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of \u03c0 bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of hybridization. For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms (Figure 8.26). We can use either of these forms to determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization is sp2. The electrons in the unhybridized p orbitals form \u03c0 bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes the electrons in the \u03c0 bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by molecular orbital theory. (See the next module."}
{"prompt":"Question: What happens when heated water is released into a body of water?\nOptions:\n A. crystalline pollution\nB. gaseous pollution\nC. geysers\nD. thermal pollution","completion":"thermal pollution\nExplanation: If heated water is released into a body of water, it may cause thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water because of an increase in water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and factories. This water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature."}

Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)."}
{"prompt":"Question: The pressurized gas of earth's atmosphere is contained by what force?\nOptions:\n A. variation\nB. gravity\nC. light\nD. plasma","completion":"gravity\nExplanation: All gases exert pressure; it is one of the fundamental measurable quantities of this phase of matter. Even our atmosphere exerts pressure\u2014in this case, the gas is being \u201cheld in\u201d by the earth\u2019s gravity, rather than the gas being in a container. The pressure of the atmosphere is about 14.7 pounds of force for every square inch of surface area: 14.7 lb\/in2. Pressure has a variety of units. The formal, SI-approved unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is defined as 1 N\/m2 (one newton of force over an area of one square meter). However, this is usually too small in magnitude to be useful. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average atmospheric pressure at sea level. However, \u201caverage atmospheric pressure at sea level\u201d is difficult to pinpoint because of atmospheric pressure variations. A more reliable and common unit is millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is the amount of pressure exerted by a column of mercury exactly 1 mm high. An equivalent unit is the torr, which equals 1 mmHg. (The torr is named after Evangelista Torricelli, a seventeenth-century Italian scientist who invented the mercury barometer. ) With these definitions of pressure, the atmosphere unit is redefined: 1 atm is defined as exactly 760 mmHg, or 760 torr. We thus have the following equivalences: 1 atm=760 mmHg=760 torr."}

{"prompt":"Question: Hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on these?\nOptions:\n A. able cells\nB. fighter cells\nC. reach cells\nD. target cells","completion":"target cells\nExplanation: 37.2 How Hormones Work Hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on target cells. The number of receptors on a target cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity. Hormones can affect cells directly through intracellular hormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane hormone receptors. Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones can enter the cell by diffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to DNA to regulate gene transcription and to change the cell\u2019s activities by inducing production of proteins that affect, in general, the long-term structure and function of the cell. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the plasma membrane surface and trigger a signaling pathway to change the cell\u2019s activities by inducing production of various cell products that affect the cell in the short-term. The hormone is called a first messenger and the cellular component is called a second messenger. G-proteins activate the second messenger (cyclic AMP), triggering the cellular response. Response to hormone binding is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. Cellular responses to hormones include the production of proteins and enzymes and altered membrane permeability."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the movement of muscle in the digestive system called?\nOptions:\n A. acid reflux\nB. labor contractions\nC. apoptosis\nD. peristalsis","completion":"peristalsis\nExplanation: The organs of the digestive system are lined with muscles. The muscles contract, or tighten, to push food through the system ( Figure below ). The muscles contract in waves. The waves pass through the digestive system like waves through a slinky. This movement of muscle contractions is called peristalsis . Without peristalsis, food would not be able to move through the digestive system. Peristalsis is an involuntary process, which means that it occurs without your conscious control."}

{"prompt":"Question: When what element - whose name means \"light bringing\" - was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air?\nOptions:\n A. oxygen\nB. mercury\nC. phosphorus\nD. neon","completion":"phosphorus\nExplanation: Phosphorus The name phosphorus comes from the Greek words meaning light bringing. When phosphorus was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 \u00b0C and boils at 280 \u00b0C. It is insoluble in water (in which it is stored\u2014see Figure 18.24), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P4 molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in Figure 18.24. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic."}
{"prompt":"Question: Tuna have been shown to contain high levels of what metal?\nOptions:\n A. mercury\nB. cadmium\nC. titanium\nD. iron","completion":"mercury\nExplanation: The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. That\u2019s why people should avoid eating too much of large fish such as tuna. Tuna are predators near the top of their food chains. They have been shown to contain high levels of mercury. In people, heavy metals can damage the brain and other organs. Unborn babies and young children are most affected. That\u2019s because their organs are still developing."}

{"prompt":"Question: What forms when a glacier scrapes a large hole in the ground?\nOptions:\n A. crater lake\nB. glacial lake\nC. underground cavern\nD. glacial hill","completion":"glacial lake\nExplanation: The depression that allows water to collect to form a lake may come about in a variety of ways. The Great Lakes, for example, are glacial lakes. A glacial lake forms when a glacier scrapes a large hole in the ground. When the glacier melts, the water fills the hole and forms a lake. A kettle lake forms in the sediment left by a glacier when a block of ice melts. Kettle lakes are found where continental glaciers once covered the land ( Figure ' below ). Over time lakes get water from rain, streams, and groundwater coming to the surface."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is a cluster of neuron cell bodies in the pns called?\nOptions:\n A. ganglion\nB. groupilion\nC. gangnem\nD. crystals","completion":"ganglion\nExplanation: Regardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell bodies of neurons or axons can be located in discrete anatomical structures that need to be named. Those names are specific to whether the structure is central or peripheral. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a nucleus. In the PNS, a cluster of neuron cell bodies is referred to as a ganglion. Figure 12.4 indicates how the term nucleus has a few different meanings within anatomy and physiology. It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the center of a cell, where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS. There is also a potentially confusing use of the word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation. In the central nervous system, there is a group of nuclei that are connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before \u201cganglion\u201d became accepted as a description for a peripheral structure. Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the \u201cbasal nuclei\u201d to avoid confusion."}

{"prompt":"Question: Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from what?\nOptions:\n A. earth\nB. water\nC. horizon\nD. sun","completion":"sun\nExplanation: Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world\u2019s energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter. This chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changes\u2014an area called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics, among other applications.

{"prompt":"Question: Extrusive igneous rocks are also called what?\nOptions:\n A. metamorphic\nB. volcanic rocks\nC. agates\nD. magma minerals","completion":"volcanic rocks\nExplanation: Extrusive igneous rocks form above the surface. The lava cools quickly as it pours out onto the surface ( Figure below ). Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks. The rapid cooling time does not allow time for large crystals to form. So igneous extrusive rocks have smaller crystals than igneous intrusive rocks. Extrusive igneous rocks are also called volcanic rocks ."}
{"prompt":"Question: The expulsion stage begins when the fetal head enters what?\nOptions:\n A. head is outside vagina\nB. you can see the umbilical cord\nC. uterus\nD. birth canal","completion":"birth canal\nExplanation: Expulsion Stage The expulsion stage begins when the fetal head enters the birth canal and ends with birth of the newborn. It typically takes up to 2 hours, but it can last longer or be completed in minutes, depending in part on the orientation of the fetus. The vertex presentation known as the occiput anterior vertex is the most common presentation and is associated with the greatest ease of vaginal birth. The fetus faces the maternal spinal cord and the smallest part of the head (the posterior aspect called the occiput) exits the birth canal first. In fewer than 5 percent of births, the infant is oriented in the breech presentation, or buttocks down. In a complete breech, both legs are crossed and oriented downward. In a frank breech presentation, the legs are oriented upward. Before the 1960s, it was common for breech presentations to be delivered vaginally. Today, most breech births are accomplished by Caesarian section. Vaginal birth is associated with significant stretching of the vaginal canal, the cervix, and the perineum. Until recent decades, it was routine procedure for an obstetrician to numb the perineum and perform an episiotomy, an incision in the posterior vaginal wall and perineum. The perineum is now more commonly allowed to tear on its own during birth. Both an episiotomy and a perineal tear need to be sutured shortly after birth to ensure optimal healing. Although suturing the jagged edges of a perineal tear may be more difficult than suturing an episiotomy, tears heal more quickly, are less painful, and are associated with less damage to the muscles around the vagina and rectum. Upon birth of the newborn\u2019s head, an obstetrician will aspirate mucus from the mouth and nose before the newborn\u2019s first breath. Once the head is birthed, the rest of the body usually follows quickly. The umbilical cord is then double-clamped, and a cut is made between the clamps. This completes the second stage of childbirth."}

The blood is more than the proteins, though. Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma (the liquid portion, which contains water, proteins, salts, lipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments called platelets. Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells are responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood clotting. Interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans, cellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent of a person\u2019s extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight."}

It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two lipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm."}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pairs of chromosomes are there?\nOptions:\n A. 16\nB. 23\nC. 25\nD. 24","completion":"23\nExplanation: During anaphase I the spindle fibers shorten, and the homologous chromosome pairs are separated from each other. This occurs as the chiasmata are severed, pulling homologous chromosomes apart. One chromosome from each pair moves toward one pole, with the other moving toward the other pole, resulting in a cell with 23 chromosomes at one pole and the other 23 at the other pole. Each chromosome still contains a pair of sister chromatids; the sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere."}

{"prompt":"Question: The prostate is formed of both muscular and which other tissues?\nOptions:\n A. glandular\nB. nonvascular tissue\nC. cartilage tissue\nD. scar","completion":"glandular\nExplanation: Prostate Gland As shown in Figure 27.2, the centrally located prostate gland sits anterior to the rectum at the base of the bladder surrounding the prostatic urethra (the portion of the urethra that runs within the prostate). About the size of a walnut, the prostate is formed of both muscular and glandular tissues. It excretes an alkaline, milky fluid to the passing seminal fluid\u2014now called semen\u2014that is critical to first coagulate and then decoagulate the semen following ejaculation. The temporary thickening of semen helps retain it within the female reproductive tract, providing time for sperm to utilize the fructose provided by seminal vesicle secretions. When the semen regains its fluid state, sperm can then pass farther into the female reproductive tract. The prostate normally doubles in size during puberty. At approximately age 25, it gradually begins to enlarge again. This enlargement does not usually cause problems; however, abnormal growth of the prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), can cause constriction of the urethra as it passes through the middle of the prostate gland, leading to a number of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as a frequent and intense urge to urinate, a weak stream, and a sensation that the bladder has not emptied completely. By age 60, approximately 40 percent of men have some degree of BPH. By age 80, the number of affected individuals has jumped to as many as 80 percent. Treatments for BPH attempt to relieve the pressure on the urethra so that urine can flow more normally. Mild to moderate symptoms are treated with medication, whereas severe enlargement of the prostate is treated by surgery in which a portion of the prostate tissue is removed. Another common disorder involving the prostate is prostate cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. However, some forms of prostate cancer grow very slowly and thus may not ever require treatment. Aggressive forms of prostate cancer, in contrast, involve metastasis to vulnerable organs like the lungs and brain. There is no link between BPH and prostate cancer, but the symptoms are similar. Prostate cancer is detected by a medical history, a blood test, and a rectal exam that allows physicians."}

{"prompt":"Question: The rate of the accumulation of neutral what serves as a type of population-based biological clock?\nOptions:\n A. prokaryotic\nB. polymorphisms\nC. enzymes\nD. eukaryotes","completion":"polymorphisms\nExplanation: would not be surprised if the surviving populations experienced serious bottlenecks. The subsequent diversification of the surviving organisms, such as the Dinosauria (which includes the extinct dinosaurs and modern birds) and the Cynodontia, which includes the ancestors of modern mammals, including us, could be due in part to these bottleneck-associated effects, for example, through the removal of competing species or predators. An astreroid impact, known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary event, occurred ~65 million years ago; it contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs and led to the diversification of mammals (which had first appeared in the fossil record ~160 million years ago). While surviving an asteroid impact (or other dramatic changes in climate) may be random, in other cases who survives a bottleneck is not. Consider the effects of a severe drought or highly virulent bacterial or viral infection; the organisms that survive may have specific phenotypes (and associated genotypes) that significantly influence their chance of survival. In such a case, the effect of the bottleneck event would produce non-random changes in the distribution of genotypes (and alleles) in the post-bottleneck population \u2013 these selective effects could continue to influence the population in various ways. For example, a trait associated with pathogen resistance may also have negative phenotypic effects. After the pathogen-driven bottleneck, mutations that mitigate the resistance trait's negative effects (and may have their own effects) can be selected. The end result is that traits that would not be selected in the absence of the pathogen, are selected. In addition, the very occurrence of a rapid and extreme reduction in population size has its own effects. For example, it would be expected to increase the effects of genetic drift (see below) and could make finding a mate more difficult. We can identify extreme population reduction events, such as founder effects and bottlenecks, by looking at the variation in genotypes (that is, the sequence of DNA molecules), particularly in genotypic changes not expected to influence phenotypes, mating preference, or reproductive success. These so-called neutral polymorphisms are expected to accumulate in the regions of the genome between genes (intragenic regions) at a constant rate over time (can you suggest why?) The rate of the accumulation of neutral polymorphisms serves as a type of population-based biological clock. Its rate can be estimated, at least roughly, by comparing the genotypes of individuals of different populations whose time of separation can be accurately estimated (assuming of course that there has been no migrations between the populations). Such studies of genomic sequence data (which we will return to later in much greater detail) indicate that the human population arose in Africa ~500,000 years ago. 119 Before this, the population leading to humans is thought to have undergone a bottleneck around ~1.2 million years ago.120 Once established, groups of modern humans migrated within and out of African, undergoing a series of founder effect events between ~45,000 to 60,000 years ago first as they migrated from southern Africa into the regions of the Horn of Africa, then into the Arabian peninsula, and from there into Europe, Asia, Oceania, and finally the Americas.

Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term describes motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as exhibited by a vibrating guitar string?\nOptions:\n A. periodic motion\nB. gravitational pull\nC. specific speed\nD. apparent motion","completion":"periodic motion\nExplanation: When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each successive vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one. We define periodic motion to be a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as exhibited by the guitar string or by an object on a spring moving up and down. The time to complete one oscillation remains constant and is called the period T . Its units are usually seconds, but may be any convenient unit of time. The word period refers to the time for some event whether repetitive or not; but we shall be primarily interested in periodic motion, which is by definition repetitive. A concept closely related to period is the frequency of an event. For example, if you get a paycheck twice a month, the frequency of payment is two per month and the period between checks is half a month. Frequency f is defined to be the number of events per unit time. For periodic motion, frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time. The relationship between frequency and period is."}

{"prompt":"Question: An electric current flows in a path called what?\nOptions:\n A. electric ring\nB. electric circuit\nC. electric course\nD. fuse","completion":"electric circuit\nExplanation: Electricity refers to a number of phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity includes such diverse things as lightning, static electricity, the current generated by a battery as it discharges, and many other influences on our daily lives. The flow or movement of charge is an electric current (Figure 17.2). Electrons or ions may carry the charge. The elementary unit of charge is the charge of a proton, which is equal in magnitude to the charge of an electron. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C) and the charge of a proton is 1.602 \u00d7 10\u221219 C. The presence of an electric charge generates an electric field. Electric current is the rate of flow of charge. The SI unit for electrical current is the SI base unit called the ampere (A), which is a flow rate of 1 coulomb of charge per second (1 A = 1 C\/s). An electric current flows in a path, called an electric circuit. In most chemical systems, it is necessary to maintain a closed path for current to flow. The flow of charge is generated by an electrical potential difference, or potential, between two points in the circuit. Electrical potential is the ability of the electric field to do work on the charge. The SI unit of electrical potential is the volt (V). When 1 coulomb of charge moves through a potential difference of 1 volt, it gains or loses 1 joule (J) of energy. Table 17.1 summarizes some of this information about electricity.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the condition of a plant in which the fluid in a cell exerts a pressure against the cell wall?\nOptions:\n A. turgor\nB. constriction\nC. tumor\nD. hydration","completion":"turgor\nExplanation: called the relative osmotic pressure if neither solution is pure water, and it is called the osmotic pressure if one solution is pure water. Osmotic pressure can be large, depending on the size of the concentration difference. For example, if pure water and sea water are separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes no salt, osmotic pressure will be 25.9 atm. This value means that water will diffuse through the membrane until the salt water surface rises 268 m above the pure-water surface! One example of pressure created by osmosis is turgor in plants (many wilt when too dry). Turgor describes the condition of a plant in which the fluid in a cell exerts a pressure against the cell wall. This pressure gives the plant support. Dialysis can similarly cause substantial pressures."}

{"prompt":"Question: Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of what type of cells, called lymphocytes?\nOptions:\n A. lung cells\nB. white blood cells\nC. brain cells\nD. red blood cells","completion":"white blood cells\nExplanation: Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells. Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow where blood is produced. In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood from performing many of its functions, like fighting off infections or preventing serious bleeding. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually white blood cells. Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. There are many types of lymphoma."}

{"prompt":"Question: What emerges from an insect egg?\nOptions:\n A. cocoon\nB. fungi\nC. larva\nD. parasite","completion":"larva\nExplanation: When an insect egg hatches, a larva emerges. The larva eats and grows and then enters the pupa stage. The pupa is immobile and may be encased in a cocoon . During the pupa stage, the insect goes through metamorphosis . Tissues and appendages of the larva break down and reorganize into the adult form. How did such an incredible transformation evolve? Metamorphosis is actually very advantageous. It allows functions to be divided between life stages. Each stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stage."}
{"prompt":"Question: What was the informal female name given to the adult fossil found in ethiopia and thought to be over 3 million years old?\nOptions:\n A. alice\nB. aunt\nC. lucy\nD. linda","completion":"lucy\nExplanation: footprints, similar to those of modern humans, were found in Laetoli, Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago. They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright. There were a number of Australopithecus species, which are often referred to as australopiths. Australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago. More is known about another early species, Australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. This species demonstrates a trend in human evolution: the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size. afarensis (Figure 29.42) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern humans. Its brain size was 380\u2013450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain. It also had prognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans. In the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult female A. afarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago (Figure 29.43). The fossil, which is informally called \u201cLucy,\u201d is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton recovered."}

{"prompt":"Question: In type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of what hormone?\nOptions:\n A. glucose\nB. hemoglobin\nC. estrogen\nD. insulin","completion":"insulin\nExplanation: In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone, but target cells do not respond to the hormone. Often, this is because target cells have because resistant to the hormone. Type 2 diabetes is an example of this type of endocrine disorder. In Type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin. As a result, cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood becomes too high. This type of diabetes is not generally treated with insulin injections. Instead, it is usually treated with medication and diet."}
{"prompt":"Question: The atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, which exerts a certain pressure referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. atmospheric pressure\nB. gravity pressure\nC. tidal pressure\nD. nitrogen pressure","completion":"atmospheric pressure\nExplanation: Gas Laws and Air Composition Gas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In natural systems, gases are normally present as a mixture of different types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (Figure 22.21). Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture. Dalton\u2019s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a gaseous mixture and states that a specific gas type in a mixture exerts its own pressure; thus, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture."}

This adjustment can occur within minutes. Respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis is not as adept as its compensation for acidosis. The normal response of the respiratory system to elevated pH is to increase the amount of CO2 in the blood by decreasing the respiratory rate to conserve CO2. There is a limit to the."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of vertebrates control body temperature to just a limited extent from the outside by changing behavior?\nOptions:\n A. etheric\nB. endothermic\nC. mimetic\nD. ectothermic","completion":"ectothermic\nExplanation: Early vertebrates were ectothermic. Ectothermy means controlling body temperature to just a limited extent from the outside by changing behavior. For example, an ectotherm might stay in the shade to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. On a cold day, an ectotherm might bask in the sun to warm up, like the snake in Figure below . Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. They can raise or lower their body temperature by their behavior but not by very much. In cold weather, an ectotherm cools down. As its body temperature drops, its metabolism slows down and it becomes inactive."}

{"prompt":"Question: In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of what?\nOptions:\n A. particles\nB. mitochondria\nC. membrane\nD. nuclei","completion":"membrane\nExplanation: In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of the membrane. The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane. Pinocytosis A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means \u201ccell drinking\u201d and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (Figure 5.21)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What can echinoderms sense with their simple eyes?\nOptions:\n A. light\nB. colors\nC. shapes\nD. electricity","completion":"light\nExplanation: Echinoderms lack respiratory and excretory systems.

{"prompt":"Question: Ion pumps, the biological machines responsible for the selective transport of metal ions, are complex assemblies of what?\nOptions:\n A. cells\nB. minerals\nC. proteins\nD. acids","completion":"proteins\nExplanation: Ion Transport The Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are important components of intracellular and extracellular fluids. Both Na+ and Ca2+ are found primarily in extracellular fluids, such as blood plasma, whereas K + and Mg2+ are found primarily in intracellular fluids. Substantial inputs of energy are required to establish and maintain these concentration gradients and prevent the system from reaching equilibrium. Thus energy is needed to transport each ion across the cell membrane toward the side with the higher concentration. The biological machines that are responsible for the selective transport of these metal ions are complex assemblies of proteins called ion pumps. Ion pumps recognize and discriminate between metal ions in the same way that crown ethers and cryptands do, with a high affinity for ions of a certain charge and radius. Defects in the ion pumps or their control mechanisms can result in major health problems. For example, cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited disease in the United States, is caused by a defect in the transport system (in this case, chloride ions). Similarly, in many cases, hypertension, or high blood pressure, is thought to be due to defective Na+ uptake and\/or excretion. If too much Na+ is absorbed from the diet (or if too little is excreted), water diffuses from tissues into the blood to dilute the solution, thereby decreasing the osmotic pressure in the circulatory system. The increased volume increases the blood pressure, and ruptured arteries called aneurysms can result, often in the brain. Because high blood pressure causes other medical problems as well, it is one of the most important biomedical disorders in modern society. For patients who suffer from hypertension, low-sodium diets that use NaCl substitutes, such as KCl, are often prescribed. Although KCl and NaCl give similar flavors to foods, the K + is not readily taken up by the highly specific Na+-uptake system. This approach to controlling hypertension is controversial, however,."}

{"prompt":"Question: In what type of mining must tunnels be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore?\nOptions:\n A. open-pit mining\nB. underground mining\nC. strip mining\nD. gold mining","completion":"underground mining\nExplanation: If an ore is deep below Earth\u2019s surface it may be too expensive to remove all the rock above it. These deposits are taken by underground mining. Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 m deep (that is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining. Tunnels must be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fresh air and lights must be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. The miners breathe in lots of particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the surrounding rock and taken out of the tunnels. Sometimes there are explosions as ore is being drilled or blasted. This can lead to a mine collapse. Miners may be hurt or killed in a mining accident."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because the earth is covered with vegetation, cellulose is the most abundant of all what?\nOptions:\n A. carbohydrates\nB. impurities\nC. vegetables\nD. rocks","completion":"carbohydrates\nExplanation: Cellulose Cellulose, a fibrous carbohydrate found in all plants, is the structural component of plant cell walls. Because the earth is covered with vegetation, cellulose is the most abundant of all carbohydrates, accounting for over 50% of all the carbon found in the vegetable kingdom. Cotton fibrils and filter paper are almost entirely cellulose (about 95%), wood is about 50% cellulose, and the dry weight of leaves is about 10%\u201320% cellulose. The largest use of cellulose is in the manufacture of paper and paper products. Although the use of noncellulose synthetic fibers is increasing, rayon (made from cellulose) and cotton still account for over 70% of textile production. Like amylose, cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose. It differs, however, in that the glucose units are joined by \u03b2-1,4-glycosidic linkages, producing a more extended structure than amylose (part (a) of Figure 16.11 \"Cellulose\"). This extreme linearity allows a great deal of hydrogen bonding between OH groups on adjacent chains, causing them to pack closely into fibers (part (b) of Figure 16.11 \"Cellulose\"). As a result, cellulose exhibits little interaction with water or any other solvent. Cotton and wood, for example, are completely insoluble in water and have considerable mechanical strength."}

Cardiac muscle fibers have a single nucleus, are branched, and joined to one another by intercalated discs that contain gap junctions for depolarization between cells and desmosomes to hold the fibers together when the heart contracts. Contraction in each cardiac muscle fiber is triggered by Ca++ ions in a similar manner as skeletal muscle, but here the Ca++ ions come from SR and through voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma. Pacemaker cells stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac muscle as a functional unit, called a syncytium."}

{"prompt":"Question: Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be this?\nOptions:\n A. stable\nB. ionic\nC. solid\nD. unstable","completion":"stable\nExplanation: The nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter. Several observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Table 21.1). Nuclei with."}
{"prompt":"Question: The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the ______ period.\nOptions:\n A. activation\nB. extraction\nC. refractory\nD. interstitial","completion":"refractory\nExplanation: The deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits acetycholinesterase. What effect would Sarin have on muscle contraction? After depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which voltagegated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane sodium\u2013potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+ back into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the process in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path?\nOptions:\n A. reversible process\nB. conductive process\nC. Remote process\nD. Different Process","completion":"reversible process\nExplanation: Reversible Processes Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in Figure 15.13 are reversible in principle. A reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in Figure 15.9), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned to its original state but the environment will not\u2014it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible. There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse. When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work. Table 15.2 summarizes the simpler thermodynamic processes and their definitions."}

{"prompt":"Question: Rising air currents carry water vapor into what?\nOptions:\n A. atmosphere\nB. stratosphere\nC. ionosphere\nD. troposphere","completion":"atmosphere\nExplanation: Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation \u2014rain, snow, sleet, hail, or freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer."}
{"prompt":"Question: What measures the amount of matter in an object?\nOptions:\n A. concentrations\nB. amounts\nC. mass\nD. weight","completion":"mass\nExplanation: The inheritance of traits is not always as simple as Mendel's rules.

{"prompt":"Question: Ionic, molecular, covalent, and metallic are major types of what state of matter?\nOptions:\n A. gas\nB. solids\nC. liquid\nD. plasma","completion":"solids\nExplanation: Summary The major types of solids are ionic, molecular, covalent, and metallic. Ionic solids consist of positively and negatively charged ions held together by electrostatic forces; the strength of the bonding is reflected in the lattice energy. Ionic solids tend to have high melting points and are rather hard. Molecular solids are held together by relatively weak forces, such as dipole\u2013dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and London dispersion forces. As a result, they tend to be rather soft and have low melting points, which depend on their molecular structure. Covalent solids consist of two- or three-dimensional networks of Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books."}

{"prompt":"Question: Air flows into the lungs largely due to a difference in what?\nOptions:\n A. gravity\nB. resistance\nC. pressure\nD. thrust","completion":"pressure\nExplanation: Pulmonary Ventilation The difference in pressures drives pulmonary ventilation because air flows down a pressure gradient, that is, air flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flows into the lungs largely due to a difference in pressure; atmospheric pressure is greater than intra-alveolar pressure, and intra-alveolar pressure is greater than intrapleural pressure. Air flows out of the lungs during expiration based on the same principle; pressure within the lungs becomes greater than the atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary ventilation comprises two major steps: inspiration and expiration. Inspiration is the process that causes air to enter the lungs, and expiration is the process that causes air to leave the lungs (Figure 22.17). A respiratory cycle is one sequence of inspiration and expiration. In general, two muscle groups are used during normal inspiration: the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. Additional muscles can be used if a bigger breath is required. When the diaphragm contracts, it moves inferiorly toward the abdominal cavity, creating a larger thoracic cavity and more space for the lungs. Contraction of the external intercostal muscles moves the ribs upward and outward, causing the rib cage to expand, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity. Due to the adhesive force of the pleural fluid, the expansion of the thoracic cavity forces the lungs to stretch and expand as well. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in intra-alveolar pressure, creating a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. As a result, a pressure gradient is created that drives air into the lungs."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the growing root tip protected by?\nOptions:\n A. root cap\nB. root flap\nC. tip cap\nD. root hinge","completion":"root cap\nExplanation: 30.3 Roots Roots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and serve as storage sites for food. Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are two other terms for dizygotic twins, which make good study subjects because they share many environmental conditions, but only about half of their polymorphisms?\nOptions:\n A. fractional\nB. identical twins\nC. interdependant twins\nD. fraternal, non-identical","completion":"fraternal, non-identical\nExplanation: Dizygotic twins (fraternal or non-identical) share only about half of their polymorphisms. These twins are helpful to study as they tend to share many aspects of their environment. As they are born in the same place, usually within a few minutes of each other, they share many environmental conditions. They had the same in utero environment, they usually have a similar or the same parenting style during their childhood, and a similar or the same education. Similarities during childhood usually occur with wealth, culture, and their community."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do tube worms rely on for food?\nOptions:\n A. fatty microorganisms\nB. chemosynthetic microorganisms\nC. lentiviruses microorganisms\nD. sponges microorganisms","completion":"chemosynthetic microorganisms\nExplanation: These brilliant red \u201cfeathers\u201d are actually animals called tube worms. They live in an extreme environment on the deep ocean floor, thousands of meters below the water\u2019s surface. Their world is always very cold and completely dark. Without sunlight, photosynthesis is not possible. So what do organisms eat at these depths? Tube worms depend on chemosynthetic microorganisms that live inside them for food. In this and other ways, tube worms have adapted to the extreme conditions of their environment."}

{"prompt":"Question: A problem with using food chains to describe ecosystems is that some organisms can feed on or be consumed by species from more than one of what level?\nOptions:\n A. trophic level\nB. biome level\nC. habitat level\nD. pH level","completion":"trophic level\nExplanation: There is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are grouped into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise, some of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. In other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. A holistic model\u2014which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment\u2014is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems. A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic, non-linear web of primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics (Figure 46.6)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane\nOptions:\n A. nutrients\nB. mirrors\nC. osmosis\nD. Gravity","completion":"osmosis\nExplanation: Osmosis Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane. Whereas diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating the two sides or halves (Figure 3.21). On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations on each side of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane. If the volume of the water is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are also different concentrations of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules?\nOptions:\n A. sunlight\nB. mixing\nC. energy\nD. heating","completion":"energy\nExplanation: Introduction Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use a great deal of energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and may be distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules. Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters are transported between cells. Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested and broken down by cells. Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy, and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella. The cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency."}
{"prompt":"Question: Abnormal electrical activity in the brain is the cause of what disease associated with seizures?\nOptions:\n A. anemia\nB. epilepsy\nC. malaria\nD. Alzheimer's","completion":"epilepsy\nExplanation: Epilepsy is a disease in which seizures occur. A seizure is a period of lost consciousness that may include violent muscle contractions. It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy may result from an infection, injury, or tumor. In many cases, however, the cause can\u2019t be identified. There is no known cure for epilepsy, but the seizures often can be prevented with medicine. Sometimes children with epilepsy outgrow it by adulthood."}

{"prompt":"Question: What phylum has the highest number of species on earth?\nOptions:\n A. lophotrochozoa\nB. arthropods\nC. cephalopods\nD. lichens","completion":"arthropods\nExplanation: 15.3 Flatworms, Nematodes, and Arthropods Flatworms are acoelomate, triploblastic animals. They lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and have a rudimentary excretory system. The digestive system is incomplete in most species. There are four traditional classes of flatworms, the largely free-living turbellarians, the ectoparasitic monogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes. Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a secondary mollusk host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place. Cestodes, or tapeworms, infect the digestive systems of primary vertebrate hosts. Nematodes are pseudocoelomate members of the clade Ecdysozoa. They have a complete digestive system and a pseudocoelomic body cavity. This phylum includes free-living as well as parasitic organisms. They include dioecious and hermaphroditic species. Nematodes have a poorly developed excretory system. Embryonic development is external and proceeds through larval stages separated by molts. Arthropods represent the most successful phylum of animals on Earth, in terms of number of species as well as the number of individuals. They are characterized by a segmented body and jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the phylum, classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages. Arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. Gills, tracheae, and book lungs facilitate respiration. Embryonic development may include multiple larval stages."}

{"prompt":"Question: What  reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction?\nOptions:\n A. pores band\nB. moderator valve\nC. pores valve\nD. moderator band","completion":"moderator band\nExplanation: The walls of the ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band (see Figure 19.9) reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from the inferior portion of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. When the right ventricle contracts, it ejects blood into the pulmonary trunk, which branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung. The superior surface of the right ventricle begins to taper as it approaches the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve that prevents backflow from the pulmonary trunk."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the name for areas where there is overlap between closely related species?\nOptions:\n A. hybrid zones\nB. mono zones\nC. extinction zones\nD. gap zones","completion":"hybrid zones\nExplanation: 18.3 Reconnection and Rates of Speciation Speciation is not a precise division: overlap between closely related species can occur in areas called hybrid zones. Organisms reproduce with other similar organisms. The fitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the evolutionary path of the two species. Scientists propose two models for the rate of speciation: one model illustrates how a species can change slowly over time; the other model demonstrates how change can occur quickly from a parent generation to a new species. Both models continue to follow the patterns of natural selection."}
{"prompt":"Question: What device is used to measure temperature?\nOptions:\n A. compass\nB. thermometer\nC. anemometer\nD. barometer","completion":"thermometer\nExplanation: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers."}

{"prompt":"Question: How do seed plants benefit from herbivores?\nOptions:\n A. dispersal of seeds\nB. radiation of seeds\nC. consumption of seeds\nD. rainfall of seeds","completion":"dispersal of seeds\nExplanation: Herbivory has been used by seed plants for their own benefit in a display of mutualistic relationships. The dispersal of fruit by animals is the most striking example. The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the plant\u2019s genetic material to a wider area. An extreme example of collaboration between an animal and a plant is the case of acacia trees and ants. The trees support the insects with shelter and food. In return, ants discourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eating insects."}

Exposure to tobacco smoke by smoking or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Regular smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as \"the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of [early] death worldwide. \"."}
{"prompt":"Question: How does lysozyme destroy bacteria?\nOptions:\n A. by antibiotic use\nB. by eating them\nC. by digesting their cell walls\nD. by paralyzing them","completion":"by digesting their cell walls\nExplanation: Another barrier is the saliva in the mouth, which is rich in lysozyme\u2014an enzyme that destroys bacteria by digesting their cell walls. The acidic environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a barrier. Additionally, the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose traps both microbes and debris, and facilitates their removal. In the case of the upper respiratory tract, ciliated epithelial cells move potentially contaminated mucus upwards to the mouth, where it is then swallowed into the digestive tract, ending up in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. Considering how often you breathe compared to how often you eat or perform other activities that expose you to pathogens, it is not surprising that multiple barrier mechanisms have evolved to work in concert to protect this vital area."}

{"prompt":"Question: What term is used to describe the electrostatic process used by most copy machines?\nOptions:\n A. electrography\nB. xerography\nC. titanomachy\nD. microphotography","completion":"xerography\nExplanation: Xerography Most copy machines use an electrostatic process called xerography\u2014a word coined from the Greek words xeros for dry and graphos for writing. The heart of the process is shown in simplified form in Figure 18.39. A selenium-coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron. Selenium is a substance with an interesting property\u2014it is a photoconductor. That is, selenium is an insulator when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light. In the first stage of the xerography process, the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium. In the second stage, the surface of the drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied. Where the image is light, the selenium becomes conducting, and the positive charge is neutralized. In dark areas, the positive charge remains, and so the image has been transferred to the drum. The third stage takes a dry black powder, called toner, and sprays it with a negative charge so that it will be attracted to the positive regions of the drum. Next, a blank piece of paper is given a greater positive charge than on the drum so that it will pull the toner from the drum. Finally, the paper and electrostatically held toner are passed through heated pressure rollers, which melt and permanently adhere the toner within the fibers of the paper."}
{"prompt":"Question: A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a what?\nOptions:\n A. vesicles\nB. symphysis\nC. mitosis\nD. Testes","completion":"symphysis\nExplanation: Symphysis A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis (\u201cgrowing together\u201d). Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral column. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by filling the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small movements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or jumping."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of plants do not typically require deep roots or woody stems?\nOptions:\n A. surface plants\nB. aquatic plants\nC. dry plants\nD. bacterial plants","completion":"aquatic plants\nExplanation: Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants . Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. There's plenty of it and it's all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants."}

{"prompt":"Question: The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials is called what?\nOptions:\n A. stellar force\nB. velocity force\nC. magnetic force\nD. centripetal force","completion":"magnetic force\nExplanation: The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other magnets, is called magnetic force . The force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other. A magnet can exert force over a distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field . In the Figure below , you can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings.

{"prompt":"Question: Some biochemical processes happen via sequences of reactions which are called what?\nOptions:\n A. synthesis\nB. mutations\nC. metabolism\nD. pathways","completion":"pathways\nExplanation: Many biochemical processes occur through sequences of reactions called pathways. The total energy released by many of these pathways is much more than the energy a cell could handle if it were all released in a single step. For example, the combustion of glucose in a single step would release enough energy to kill a cell. By using a series of smaller steps that release less energy per reaction, however, the cell can extract the maximum energy from glucose without being destroyed. Referring to Equation 5.30, calculate how many grams of glucose would need to be metabolized to raise the temperature of a liver cell from an average body 3."}

{"prompt":"Question: In which process do two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier nucleus and great energy?\nOptions:\n A. general fusion\nB. light fusion\nC. nuclear fusion\nD. certain fusion","completion":"nuclear fusion\nExplanation: Summary Nuclear reactions are accompanied by large changes in energy, which result in detectable changes in mass. The change in mass is related to the change in energy according to Einstein\u2019s equation: \u0394E = (\u0394m)c2. Large changes in energy are usually reported in kiloelectronvolts or megaelectronvolts (thousands or millions of electronvolts). With the exception of 1H, the experimentally determined mass of an atom is always less than the sum of the masses of the component particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons) by an amount called the mass defect of the nucleus. The energy corresponding to the mass defect is the nuclear binding energy, the amount of energy released when a nucleus forms from its component particles. In nuclear fission, nuclei split into lighter nuclei with an accompanying release of multiple neutrons and large amounts of energy. Thecritical mass is the minimum mass required to support a self-sustainingnuclear chain reaction. Nuclear fusion is a process in which two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier nucleus plus a great deal of energy."}
{"prompt":"Question: What reflex is commonly tested in newborn infants to establish the presence of neuromuscular function?\nOptions:\n A. phalanges\nB. renal\nC. plantar\nD. glandular","completion":"plantar\nExplanation: Approximate colors are shown, along with pKin values and the pH range over which the color changes. It is important to be aware that an indicator does not change color abruptly at a particular pH value; instead, it actually undergoes a pH titration just like any other acid or base. As the concentration of HIn decreases and the concentration of In\u2212 increases, the color of the solution slowly changes from the characteristic color of HIn to that of In\u2212. As we will see in Section 16.6 \"Buffers\", the [In\u2212]\/[HIn] ratio changes from 0.1 at a pH one unit below pKin to 10 at a pH one unit above pKin. Thus most indicators change color over a pH range of about two pH units. We have stated that a good indicator should have a pKin value that is close to the expected pH at the equivalence point. For a strong acid\u2013strong base titration, the choice of the indicator is not especially critical due to the very large change in pH that occurs around the equivalence point.

{"prompt":"Question: What do you call an animal that feeds on other animals?\nOptions:\n A. carnivore\nB. omnivore\nC. herbivore\nD. polyvore","completion":"carnivore\nExplanation: Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods and different predators. Birds can be carnivores (feeding on other animals), herbivores (feeding on plants), or generalists (feeding on a variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks like. For example, can you think of some examples of beaks that are adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The American Crow is an example of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal) that is specially adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for reaching into flowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other foods."}

{"prompt":"Question: When a male directly deposits sperm in a female during mating, this is considered what type of fertilization?\nOptions:\n A. internal\nB. dual\nC. mechanical\nD. external","completion":"internal\nExplanation: Internal Fertilization Internal fertilization occurs most often in terrestrial animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. Internal fertilization may occur by the male directly depositing sperm in the female during mating. It may also occur by the male depositing sperm in the environment, usually in a protective structure, which a female picks up to deposit the sperm in her reproductive tract. There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female\u2019s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg (Figure 18.7a). This occurs in some bony fish, some reptiles, a few cartilaginous fish, some amphibians, a few mammals, and all birds. Most non-avian reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and some turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. Chicken eggs are an example of a hard shell. The eggs of the egg-laying mammals such as the platypus and echidna are leathery. In ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, and the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg\u2019s yolk. The eggs are retained in the female\u2019s body until they hatch inside of her, or she lays the eggs right before they hatch. This process helps protect the eggs until hatching. This occurs in some bony fish (like the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus, Figure 18.7b), some sharks, lizards, some snakes (garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa). In viviparity the young are born alive. They obtain their nourishment from the female and are born in varying states of maturity. This occurs in most mammals (Figure 18.7c), some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles."}

{"prompt":"Question: A spontaneous change process called neutrino oscillations can occur only if neutrinos have what property?\nOptions:\n A. velocity\nB. mass\nC. temperature\nD. color","completion":"mass\nExplanation: that the weak interaction could change quark flavor. It should also change neutrino flavor\u2014that is, any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other, a process called neutrino oscillations. However, this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass. Why? Crudely, because if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light and time will not pass for them, so that they cannot change without an interaction. In 1999, results began to be published containing convincing evidence that neutrino oscillations do occur. Using the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan, the oscillations have been observed and are being verified and further explored at present at the same facility and others. Neutrino oscillations may also explain the low number of observed solar neutrinos.

Injection of anti-Rh antibody during the first pregnancy prevents the immune response from occurring. 4 D 6 A 8 D 10 B 12 D 14 C 16 C 18 D 20 C 22 If the MHC I molecules expressed on donor cells differ from the MHC I molecules expressed on recipient cells, NK cells may identify the donor cells as \u201cnon-self\u201d and produce perforin and granzymes to induce the donor cells to undergo apoptosis, which would destroy the transplanted organ. 24 An antigen is a molecule that reacts with some component of the immune response (antibody, B cell receptor, T cell receptor). An epitope is the region on the antigen through which binding with the immune component actually occurs. 26 The TH1 response involves the secretion of cytokines to stimulate macrophages and CTLs and improve their destruction of intracellular pathogens and tumor cells. It is associated with inflammation. The TH2 response is involved in the stimulation of B cells into plasma cells that synthesize and secrete antibodies. 28 T cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC molecules by APCs. In contrast, B cells function themselves as APCs to bind intact, unprocessed antigens. 30 Cross reactivity of antibodies can be beneficial when it allows an individual's immune system to respond to an array of similar pathogens after being exposed to just one of them. A potential cost of cross reactivity is an antibody response to parts of the body (self) in addition to the appropriate antigen."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dna is normally found within what region of a cell?\nOptions:\n A. genome sequence\nB. nucleus\nC. mitochondria\nD. Golgi apparatus","completion":"nucleus\nExplanation: the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or more nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome synthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of the cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely contained structure called chromatin within the nucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a variety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to divide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to form chromosomes. There is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your body. The result is billions of new cells being created each day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must replicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will receive an exact copy of the organism\u2019s genome. A variety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication. These enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate the two strands, and assist with the building of complementary strands along each parent strand. The original DNA strands serve as templates from which the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are determined and synthesized. When replication is completed, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each one contains one original strand and one newly synthesized complementary strand."}

A moderator slows neutrons produced by nuclear reactions so that they can be absorbed by the fuel and cause additional nuclear reactions. A coolant. The coolant carries heat from the fission reaction to an external boiler and turbine where it is transformed into electricity."}

{"prompt":"Question: To measure what changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity, calledenthalpy?\nOptions:\n A. ion exchange\nB. evaporation\nC. energy\nD. entropy","completion":"energy\nExplanation: (a) Initially, the system (a copper penny and concentrated nitric acid) is at atmospheric pressure. (b) When the penny is added to the nitric acid, the volume of NO2 gas that is formed causes the piston to move upward to maintain the system at atmospheric pressure. In doing so, the system is performing work on its surroundings. The symbol E in represents the internal energy of a system, which is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of all its components. It is the change in internal energy that produces heat plus work. To measure the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity calledenthalpy (H) (from the Greek enthalpein, meaning \u201cto warm\u201d). The enthalpy of a system is defined as the sum of its internal energy E plus the product of its pressure Pand volume V:."}
{"prompt":"Question: What molecule can be used by the body to synthesize cholesterol ?\nOptions:\n A. ethylene coa\nB. hydroxide coa\nC. acetyl coa\nD. chloride coa","completion":"acetyl coa\nExplanation: Because of the link between high levels of cholesterol and heart disease, it is commonly seen by the general public as a \u201cbad\u201d molecule. However, cholesterol plays a vital role in the body, as both a structural component of cell membranes and a metabolic precursor to various steroid hormones. Only about 30% of the cholesterol in our bodies comes from our diet; the rest is synthesized in the liver, intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs. The same acetyl CoA molecule that provides biochemical energy can also be used by the body to synthesize cholesterol. There are approximately twenty-two steps involved in the formation of cholesterol from acetyl CoA."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does the body derive from the breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume?\nOptions:\n A. insulin\nB. lipids\nC. amino acids\nD. glucose","completion":"glucose\nExplanation: Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon Glucose is required for cellular respiration and is the preferred fuel for all body cells. The body derives glucose from the breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume. Glucose not immediately taken up by cells for fuel can be stored by the liver and muscles as glycogen, or converted to triglycerides and stored in the adipose tissue. Hormones regulate both the storage and the utilization of glucose as required. Receptors located in the pancreas sense blood glucose levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels."}

{"prompt":"Question: Practical limits of van de graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually do what to surrounding materials?\nOptions:\n A. ionize\nB. displace\nC. isolate\nD. decompose","completion":"ionize\nExplanation: The Van de Graaff Generator Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity\u2014they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.38 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits."}
{"prompt":"Question: Activities that can reduce the effects of what condition include exercises to keep the blood and lymph flowing through affected areas?\nOptions:\n A. anemia\nB. inflammation\nC. asthma\nD. edema","completion":"edema\nExplanation: Medications that can result in edema include vasodilators, calcium channel blockers used to treat hypertension, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen therapies, and some diabetes medications. Underlying medical conditions that can contribute to edema include congestive heart failure, kidney damage and kidney disease, disorders that affect the veins of the legs, and cirrhosis and other liver disorders. Therapy for edema usually focuses on elimination of the cause. Activities that can reduce the effects of the condition include appropriate exercises to keep the blood and lymph flowing through the affected areas. Other therapies include elevation of the affected part to assist drainage, massage and compression of the areas to move the fluid out of the tissues, and decreased salt intake to decrease sodium and water retention."}

More medicines are expected to be discovered in nature. Loss of biodiversity will impact the number of pharmaceuticals available to humans. Crop diversity is a requirement for food security, and it is being lost. The loss of wild relatives to crops also threatens breeders\u2019 abilities to create new varieties. Ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support human agriculture: pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil development and maintenance. Loss of biodiversity threatens these ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or impossible. Wild food sources are mainly aquatic, but few are being managed for sustainability. Fisheries\u2019 ability to provide protein to human populations is threatened when extinction occurs. Biodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to humans. Additionally, there are moral arguments for the maintenance of biodiversity."}

{"prompt":"Question: What were the first forms of life on earth?\nOptions:\n A. prokaryotes\nB. aniryotes\nC. eukaryotes\nD. protists","completion":"prokaryotes\nExplanation: Prokaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth When and where did life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? Prokaryotes were the first forms of life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are thought to be about 4.54 billion years old. This estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate material from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular oxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where they were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the Earth. At this time too, strong volcanic activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms\u2014the first prokaryotes\u2014were adapted to very high temperatures. Early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from the sun. The first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions. Microbial Mats Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that includes mostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix. The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth\u2019s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source\u2014sunlight\u2014whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food."}

{"prompt":"Question: A group of atoms that results when one hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane is referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. alkyl group\nB. chloride group\nC. hyrdrogen group\nD. nitrate group","completion":"alkyl group\nExplanation: An alkyl group is a group of atoms that results when one hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane. The group is named by replacing the -ane suffix of the parent hydrocarbon with -yl. For example, the CH3 group derived from methane (CH4) results from subtracting one hydrogen atom and is called a methyl group. The alkyl groups we will use most frequently are listed in Table 12.4 \"Common Alkyl Groups\". Alkyl groups are not independent molecules; they are parts of molecules that we consider as a unit to name compounds systematically. Table 12.4 Common Alkyl Groups."}

{"prompt":"Question: What does the ubiquitous generator use to generate currents?\nOptions:\n A. inertia\nB. water\nC. magnetism\nD. gravity","completion":"magnetism\nExplanation: The hint of symmetry between electricity and magnetism found in the preceding chapter will be elaborated upon in this chapter. Specifically, we know that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetric here, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. The Hall effect is a voltage caused by a magnetic force. That voltage could drive a current. Historically, it was very shortly after Oersted discovered currents cause magnetic fields that other scientists asked the following question: Can magnetic fields cause currents? The answer was soon found by experiment to be yes. In 1831, some 12 years after Oersted\u2019s discovery, the English scientist Michael Faraday (1791\u20131862) and the American scientist Joseph Henry (1797\u20131878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating emfs (electromotive force) and, hence, currents with magnetic fields is known as induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which utilizes the Coulomb force. Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The ubiquitous generator\u2014found in automobiles, on bicycles, in nuclear power plants, and so on\u2014uses magnetism to generate current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances. Not so familiar perhaps, but important nevertheless, is that the behavior of AC circuits depends strongly on the effect of magnetic fields on currents."}
{"prompt":"Question: The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of what?\nOptions:\n A. progesterone\nB. secretin\nC. gastrin\nD. oxygen","completion":"secretin\nExplanation: Pancreatic Secretion Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the duct cells to release bicarbonaterich pancreatic juice. The presence of proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which then stimulates the acini to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice and enhances the activity of secretin. Parasympathetic regulation occurs mainly during the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric secretion, when vagal stimulation prompts the secretion of pancreatic juice. Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCl produced in the stomach. Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the liver."}
{"prompt":"Question: After what life stage does the fusion inside a star end?\nOptions:\n A. red giant\nB. blue giant\nC. yellow dwarf\nD. white dwarf","completion":"red giant\nExplanation: After a star becomes a red giant, it will take one of several different paths to end its life. Which path is followed by a star after the red giant phase depends on its mass. During the fusion life of a star, its size is the result of a competition between fusion heat pushing the material out and gravity pulling the material in. At the end, gravity always wins. After the star has lived through its red giant stage, the fusion essentially ends (the star runs out of fuel) allowing gravity to collapse the star. Some of the outer layers of material will be blown away and the core becomes smaller and denser. The core will become either a neutron star, a white dwarf, a black dwarf, or a black hole."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is another name for composite volcanos?\nOptions:\n A. fjords\nB. fault lines\nC. stratovolcanoes\nD. seismic giants","completion":"stratovolcanoes\nExplanation: Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash ( Figure below ). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. The composition of magma that erupts at composite volcanoes is usually felsic (rhyolite) or intermediate (andesite)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What forms as a result of decomposition when n2o  is heated?\nOptions:\n A. ammonia and nitrogren\nB. nitrogen and hydrogen\nC. nitrogen and oxygen\nD. calcium and oxygen","completion":"nitrogen and oxygen\nExplanation: The oxides of nitrogen(III), nitrogen(IV), and nitrogen(V) react with water and form nitrogen-containing oxyacids. Nitrogen(III) oxide, N2O3, is the anhydride of nitrous acid; HNO2 forms when N2O3 reacts with water. There are no stable oxyacids containing nitrogen with an oxidation state of 4+; therefore, nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2, disproportionates in one of two ways when it reacts with water. In cold water, a mixture of HNO2 and HNO3 forms. At higher temperatures, HNO3 and NO will form. Nitrogen(V) oxide, N2O5, is the anhydride of nitric acid; HNO3 is produced when N2O5 reacts with water: N 2 O 5(s) + H 2 O(l) \u27f6 2HNO 3(aq) The nitrogen oxides exhibit extensive oxidation-reduction behavior. Nitrous oxide resembles oxygen in its behavior when heated with combustible substances. N2O is a strong oxidizing agent that decomposes when heated to form nitrogen and oxygen. Because one-third of the gas liberated is oxygen, nitrous oxide supports combustion better than air (one-fifth oxygen). A glowing splinter bursts into flame when thrust into a bottle of this gas. Nitric oxide acts both as an oxidizing agent and as a reducing agent. For example: oxidizing agent: P 4(s) + 6NO(g) \u27f6 P 4 O 6(s) + 3N 2(g)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths?\nOptions:\n A. immersion\nB. saturation\nC. dispersion\nD. combustion","completion":"dispersion\nExplanation: We see about six colors in a rainbow\u2014red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet; sometimes indigo is listed, too. Those colors are associated with different wavelengths of light, as shown in Figure 25.22. When our eye receives pure-wavelength light, we tend to see only one of the six colors, depending on wavelength. The thousands of other hues we can sense in other situations are our eye\u2019s response to various mixtures of wavelengths. White light, in particular, is a fairly uniform mixture of all visible wavelengths. Sunlight, considered to be white, actually appears to be a bit yellow because of its mixture of wavelengths, but it does contain all visible wavelengths. The sequence of colors in rainbows is the same sequence as the colors plotted versus wavelength in Figure 25.22. What this implies is that white light is spread out according to wavelength in a rainbow. Dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths. More technically, dispersion occurs whenever there is a process that changes the direction of light in a manner that depends on wavelength. Dispersion, as a general phenomenon, can occur for any type of wave and always involves wavelength-dependent processes. Dispersion Dispersion is defined to be the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of reproduction involves combining genetic material from two parents to create distinct offspring?\nOptions:\n A. mild reproduction\nB. sexual reproduction\nC. bsexual reproduction\nD. asexual reproduction","completion":"sexual reproduction\nExplanation: That is the main difference between sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is combining genetic material from two parents, usually from two gametes. How the two cells combine may take many forms, but does not necessarily involve physical contact. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically distinct from other offspring and from their parents. Asexual reproduction produces offspring from just one parent. These offspring are genetically identical to that one parent."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do most amphibians breathe with as larvae?\nOptions:\n A. pores\nB. gills\nC. lungs\nD. nasal passages","completion":"gills\nExplanation: Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. Additional oxygen is absorbed through the skin in most species. The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some species, mucous glands also produce toxins, which help protect the amphibians from predators. The golden frog shown in Figure below is an example of a toxic amphibian."}
{"prompt":"Question: What does a cell need to transform into a cancerous cell?\nOptions:\n A. microbes\nB. parasites\nC. adaptations\nD. mutations","completion":"mutations\nExplanation: Typically, a series of several mutations that constitutively activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes is required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell ( Figure below ). Cells have developed a number of control mechanisms to overcome mutations in proto-oncogenes. Therefore, a cell needs multiple mutations to transform into a cancerous cell. A mutation in one proto-oncogene would not cause cancer, as the effects of the mutation would be masked by the normal control of the cell cycle and the actions of tumor suppressor genes. Similarly, a mutation in one tumor suppressor gene would not cause cancer either, due to the presence of many \"backup\" genes that duplicate its functions. It is only when enough proto-oncogenes have mutated into oncogenes and enough tumor suppressor genes have been deactivated that the cancerous transformation can begin. Signals for cell growth overwhelm the signals for growth regulation, and the cell quickly spirals out of control. Often, because many of these genes regulate the processes that prevent most damage to the genes themselves, DNA damage accumulates as one ages."}

{"prompt":"Question: Winter storms develop from what, which form at high altitudes and are associated with hurricanes as well?\nOptions:\n A. fronts\nB. currents\nC. cyclones\nD. droughts","completion":"cyclones\nExplanation: Like hurricanes, winter storms develop from cyclones. But in the case of winter storms, the cyclones form at higher latitudes. In North America, cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter. This lets dry polar air pour south. At the same time, warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north. When the two air masses meet, the differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy precipitation. Two types of winter storms that occur in the U. S. are blizzards and lake-effect snow storms."}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next called?\nOptions:\n A. inherited traits\nB. generational traits\nC. genetic traits\nD. familial traits","completion":"inherited traits\nExplanation: The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time. Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next. For example, your eye color is an inherited trait. You inherited your eye color from your parents. Inherited traits are different from acquired traits , or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles from working out ( Figure below )."}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of transport is vesicle transport considered to be?\nOptions:\n A. passive transport\nB. intercellular transport\nC. catalyst\nD. active transport","completion":"active transport\nExplanation: Some molecules, such as proteins, are too large to pass through the plasma membrane, regardless of their concentration inside and outside the cell. Very large molecules cross the plasma membrane with a different sort of help, called vesicle transport . Vesicle transport requires energy, so it is also a form of active transport. There are two types of vesicle transport: endocytosis and exocytosis. Both types are shown in Figure below and described below."}

{"prompt":"Question: Chytridiomycota are considered the most primitive of what kingdom?\nOptions:\n A. animals\nB. plants\nC. protists\nD. fungi","completion":"fungi\nExplanation: 24.2 Classifications of Fungi Chytridiomycota (chytrids) are considered the most primitive group of fungi. They are mostly aquatic, and their gametes are the only fungal cells known to have flagella. They reproduce both sexually and asexually; the asexual spores are called zoospores. Zygomycota (conjugated fungi) produce non-septated hyphae with many nuclei. Their hyphae fuse during sexual reproduction to produce a zygospore in a zygosporangium. Ascomycota (sac fungi) form spores in sacs called asci during sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is their most common form of reproduction. Basidiomycota (club fungi) produce showy fruiting bodies that contain basidia in the form of clubs. Spores are stored in the basidia. Most familiar mushrooms belong to this division. Fungi that have no known sexual cycle were classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota, which the present classification puts in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Glomeromycota form tight associations (called mycorrhizae) with the roots of plants."}

{"prompt":"Question: Dense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. as a consequence, it displays greater resistance to what?\nOptions:\n A. freezing\nB. contracting\nC. stretching\nD. stiffening","completion":"stretching\nExplanation: Dense Connective Tissue Dense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it displays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and irregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance to stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective tissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to collagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal folds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic. In dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater strength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a mesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same orientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle. The dermis of the skin is an example of dense irregular connective tissue rich in collagen fibers. Dense irregular elastic tissues give arterial walls the strength and the ability to regain original shape after stretching (Figure 4.15)."}

{"prompt":"Question: What are telescopes that use lenses to bend light called?\nOptions:\n A. refracting telescopes\nB. reflecting telescopes\nC. sliding telescopes\nD. layering telescopes","completion":"refracting telescopes\nExplanation: Telescopes that use lenses to bend light are called refracting telescopes , or refractors ( Figure below ). The earliest telescopes were all refractors. Many amateur astronomers still use refractors today. Refractors are good for viewing details within our solar system. Craters on the surface of Earth\u2019s Moon or the rings around Saturn are two such details."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is pressure times area equal to?\nOptions:\n A. volume\nB. force\nC. mass\nD. density","completion":"force\nExplanation: There is a pressure difference when the channel narrows. This pressure difference results in a net force on the fluid: recall that pressure times area equals force. The net work done increases the fluid\u2019s kinetic energy. As a result, the pressure will drop in a rapidly-moving fluid, whether or not the fluid is confined to a tube. There are a number of common examples of pressure dropping in rapidly-moving fluids. Shower curtains have a disagreeable habit of bulging into the shower stall when the shower is on. The high-velocity stream of water and air creates a region of lower pressure inside the shower, and standard atmospheric pressure on the other side. The pressure difference results in a net force inward pushing the curtain in. You may also have noticed that when passing a truck on the highway, your car tends to veer toward it. The reason is the same\u2014the high velocity of the air between the car and the truck creates a region of lower pressure, and the vehicles are pushed together by greater pressure on the outside. (See Figure 12.4. ) This effect was observed as far back as the mid-1800s, when it was found that trains passing in opposite directions tipped precariously toward one another."}

{"prompt":"Question: What neurotransmitter is associated with the fight-or-flight response?\nOptions:\n A. adrenaline\nB. stomach acid\nC. bile\nD. endorphins","completion":"adrenaline\nExplanation: Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is a hormone and a neurotransmitter. It increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, dilates air passages, and participates in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenaline is produced in the adrenal medulla of the adrenal gland. So how does it effect processes all over the body?."}
{"prompt":"Question: What structure is an organelle that contains enzymes that break down and digest unneeded cellular components?\nOptions:\n A. peroxisome\nB. lysosome\nC. tissue\nD. centrosome","completion":"lysosome\nExplanation: Lysosomes Some of the protein products packaged by the Golgi include digestive enzymes that are meant to remain inside the cell for use in breaking down certain materials. The enzyme-containing vesicles released by the Golgi may form new lysosomes, or fuse with existing, lysosomes. A lysosome is an organelle that contains enzymes that break down and digest unneeded cellular components, such as a damaged organelle. (A lysosome is similar to a wrecking crew that takes down old and unsound buildings in a neighborhood. ) Autophagy (\u201cself-eating\u201d) is the process of a cell digesting its own structures. Lysosomes are also important for breaking down foreign material. For example, when certain immune defense cells (white blood cells) phagocytize bacteria, the bacterial cell is transported into a lysosome and digested by the enzymes inside. As one might imagine, such phagocytic defense cells contain large numbers of lysosomes. Under certain circumstances, lysosomes perform a more grand and dire function. In the case of damaged or unhealthy cells, lysosomes can be triggered to open up and release their digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm of the cell, killing the cell. This \u201cself-destruct\u201d mechanism is called autolysis, and makes the process of cell death controlled (a mechanism called \u201capoptosis\u201d)."}

{"prompt":"Question: Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat what?\nOptions:\n A. soil\nB. plants\nC. dead material\nD. primary consumers","completion":"primary consumers\nExplanation: Food Chains and Food Webs The term \u201cfood chain\u201d is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations. In this sense, food chains are thought of as a competition for survival, such as \u201cwho eats whom?\u201d Someone eats and someone is eaten. Therefore, it is not surprising that in our competitive \u201cdog-eat-dog\u201d society, individuals who are considered successful are seen as being at the top of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are seen as being at the bottom. The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage. In ecology, a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through the chain. Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level. Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels. In many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and\/or phytoplankton), which are called primary producers. The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary consumers. Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food chain: the apex consumers. In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 46.4, the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain."}

{"prompt":"Question: What do organisms use to grow and repair themselves?\nOptions:\n A. diffusion\nB. mutation\nC. cell solution\nD. cell division","completion":"cell division\nExplanation: Cell division is how organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how they produce offspring. Many single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. In many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are not identical to the parents. In fact, each offspring is unique. Look at the family in Figure below . The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents. In this lesson, you will learn how this happens."}

{"prompt":"Question: Because they are charged (polar), these ions do not diffuse through what?\nOptions:\n A. substrate\nB. membrane\nC. cell wall\nD. protein","completion":"membrane\nExplanation: Ions such as sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), and chloride (Cl - ), are important for many cell functions. Because they are charged (polar), these ions do not diffuse through the membrane. Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Ion channels allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Ion channels are very specific, as they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane. Some ion channels are always open, others are \"gated\" and can be opened or closed. Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different types of stimuli, such as electrical or chemical signals."}
{"prompt":"Question: The three types of mammals are characterized by their method of what?\nOptions:\n A. reproduction\nB. specializaiton\nC. differentiation\nD. pattern","completion":"reproduction\nExplanation: There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction. All mammals, except for a few, are viviparous , meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The monotremes , however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums. These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother's body, where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is the majority of mammals, are placental mammals. These mammals develop in the mother's uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. Placental mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews, and armadillos. Dogs and cats, and sheep, cattle and horses are also placental mammals."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the term for a formula that shows the elements in a compound in their lowest whole-number ratio?\nOptions:\n A. measured formula\nB. intrinsic formula\nC.

{"prompt":"Question: Three distinct layers or tunics form the walls of what structures; the first is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells in contact with the red blood cells?\nOptions:\n A. lungs\nB. white blood cells\nC. alveoli\nD. blood vessels","completion":"blood vessels\nExplanation: The structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. There are three distinct layers, or tunics, that form the walls of blood vessels (Figure 40.16). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries, this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure. Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower. In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to the heart."}

{"prompt":"Question: Olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are related to what type of function?\nOptions:\n A. pulmonary\nB. respiratory\nC. sensory\nD. digestion","completion":"sensory\nExplanation: Sensory Nerves The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves I, II, and VIII) are dedicated to four of the special senses: smell, vision, equilibrium, and hearing, respectively. Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. The trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve that carries the general somatic senses from the head, similar to those coming through spinal nerves from the rest of the body. Testing smell is straightforward, as common smells are presented to one nostril at a time. The patient should be able to recognize the smell of coffee or mint, indicating the proper functioning of the olfactory system. Loss of the sense of smell is called anosmia and can be lost following blunt trauma to the head or through aging. The short axons of the first cranial nerve regenerate on a regular basis. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a limited life span, and new cells grow to replace the ones that die off. The axons from these neurons grow back into the CNS by following the existing axons\u2014representing one of the few examples of such growth in the mature nervous system. If all of the fibers are sheared when the brain moves within the cranium, such as in a motor vehicle accident, then no axons can find their way back to the olfactory bulb to reestablish connections. If the nerve is not completely severed, the anosmia may be temporary as new neurons can eventually reconnect."}

{"prompt":"Question: What system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that sustain organisms?\nOptions:\n A. tissue\nB. skeletal\nC. respiratory\nD. digestive","completion":"digestive\nExplanation: Parts of the Digestive System The vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that sustain organisms. Oral Cavity The oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 34.9. The food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food. The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands that secrete saliva\u2014the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the."}
{"prompt":"Question: Not all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. in rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of what?\nOptions:\n A. new species\nB. new order\nC. new mutation\nD. new family","completion":"new species\nExplanation: The Chromosome 18 Inversion Not all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans. The pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human. A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes\u2014ROCK1 and USP14\u2014that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way. Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, [1] but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates. Translocations A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome. Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have been associated with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information (Figure 13.13)."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the male gamete called in humans?\nOptions:\n A. dna\nB. egg\nC. testes\nD. sperm","completion":"sperm\nExplanation: 27.1 | Anatomy and Physiology of the Male Reproductive System By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe the structure and function of the organs of the male reproductive system \u2022 Describe the structure and function of the sperm cell \u2022 Explain the events during spermatogenesis that produce haploid sperm from diploid cells \u2022 Identify the importance of testosterone in male reproductive function Unique for its role in human reproduction, a gamete is a specialized sex cell carrying 23 chromosomes\u2014one half the number in body cells. At fertilization, the chromosomes in one male gamete, called a sperm (or spermatozoon), combine with the chromosomes in one female gamete, called an oocyte. The function of the male reproductive system (Figure 27.2) is to produce sperm and transfer them to the female reproductive tract. The paired testes are a crucial component in this process, as they produce both sperm and androgens, the hormones that support male reproductive physiology. In humans, the most important male androgen is testosterone. Several accessory organs and ducts aid the process of sperm maturation and transport the sperm and other seminal components to the penis, which delivers sperm to the female reproductive tract. In this section, we examine each of these different structures, and discuss the process of sperm production and transport."}

{"prompt":"Question: The process of transferring pollen from the male reproductive part of a flower known as the anthers to the female reproductive part of the flower known as the stigma is referred to as what?\nOptions:\n A. pollination\nB. inoculation\nC. fertilization\nD. reproduction","completion":"pollination\nExplanation: In order to study these characteristics, Mendel needed to control the pollination of the pea plants through artificial fertilization . Pollination occurs when the pollen from the male reproductive part of a flower, called the anthers , is transferred to the female reproductive part of a flower, called the stigma . Pea plants are self-pollinating , which means the pollen from a flower on a single plant transfers to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. In order to avoid self-pollination, Mendel removed the anthers from the flowers on a plant. He then carefully transferred pollen from the anthers of another plant and using a small paintbrush, dusted the pollen onto the stigma of the flowers that lacked anthers. This process caused cross-pollination. The Figure below shows the location of the male and female parts of a flower. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen from one flower pollinates a flower on a different plant. In this way, Mendel controlled the characteristics that were passed onto the offspring. The product of cross-pollination is known as a hybrid. The ability to cross-pollinate pea plants allowed Mendel to study the offspring of two parents with different traits, such as a tall stem or a short stem."}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the medical process of removing wastes and excess water from the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration called?\nOptions:\n A. tumors\nB. dialysis\nC. digestion\nD. arthritis","completion":"dialysis\nExplanation: Dialysis Technician Dialysis is a medical process of removing wastes and excess water from the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration. When kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes. This is a vital process to keep patients alive. In some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a life-long necessity. Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment development and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. This can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include taking and reporting a patient\u2019s vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and sterile procedures."}
{"prompt":"Question: Food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, a process involving action by what structures?\nOptions:\n A. cilia\nB. proteins\nC. tonsils\nD. teeth","completion":"teeth\nExplanation: Oral Cavity Both physical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth or oral cavity, which is the point of entry of food into the digestive system. The food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food to begin the process of physically breaking it down into smaller particles. The chemical process of digestion begins during chewing as food mixes with saliva, produced by the salivary glands (Figure 16.5). Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains lysozyme, which has antibacterial action. It also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced by cells in the tongue to break down fats. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing\u2014moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus leads to the stomach and the trachea leads to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that covers the tracheal opening during swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs."}

{"prompt":"Question: How do invertebrates reproduce?\nOptions:\n A. sexually\nB. randomly\nC. constantly\nD. asexually","completion":"sexually\nExplanation: Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. Diploid adults produce haploid gametes (sperm and eggs). In some species, the same individuals produce both sperm and eggs. In other species, sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female individuals. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into an embryo and eventually into a new adult organism. On the way, it may pass through one or more larval stages. A larva (plural, larvae) is a juvenile, or immature, stage of an animal. It is generally quite different in form and function from the adult form of the species. For example, the larva may be able to swim freely, whereas the adult must remain permanently attached to a solid surface."}

{"prompt":"Question: What (nh3) is one of the few thermodynamically stable binary compounds of nitrogen with a nonmetal?\nOptions:\n A. liquid nitrogen\nB. ammonia\nC. acetic acid\nD. nitrous oxide","completion":"ammonia\nExplanation: Note the Pattern Few binary molecular compounds of nitrogen are formed by the direct reaction of the elements. At elevated temperatures, nitrogen reacts with highly electropositive metals to formionic nitrides, such as Li3N and Ca3N2. These compounds consist of ionic lattices formed by M n+ and N3\u2212 ions. Just as boron forms interstitial borides and carbon forms interstitial carbides, with less electropositive metals nitrogen forms a range ofinterstitial nitrides, in which nitrogen occupies holes in a close-packed metallic structure. Like the interstitial carbides and borides, these substances are typically very hard, high-melting materials that have metallic luster and conductivity. Nitrogen also reacts with semimetals at very high temperatures to produce covalent nitrides, such as Si3N4 and BN, which are solids with extended covalent network structures similar to those of graphite or diamond. Consequently, they are usually high melting and chemically inert materials. Ammonia (NH3) is one of the few thermodynamically stable binary compounds of nitrogen with a nonmetal. It is not flammable in air, but it burns in an O2 atmosphere: Equation 22.30."}
{"prompt":"Question: What part of the body do hookworms infest?\nOptions:\n A. intestines\nB. lungs\nC. skin\nD. brain","completion":"intestines\nExplanation: Hookworms, such as Ancyclostoma and Necator, infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals, especially in dogs, cats, and humans. Trichina worms (Trichinella) are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans, often resulting from the consumption of undercooked pork; Trichinella can infect other mammalian hosts as well. Ascaris, a large intestinal roundworm, steals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines. The filarial worms, such as Dirofilaria and Wuchereria, are commonly vectored by mosquitoes, which pass the infective agents among mammals through their blood-sucking activity. Dirofilaria immitis, a blood-infective parasite, is the notorious dog heartworm species. Wuchereria bancrofti infects the lymph nodes of humans, resulting in the non-lethal but deforming condition called elephantiasis, in which parts of the body become swelled to gigantic proportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage and inflammation of lymphatic tissues."}

{"prompt":"Question: In what form of lipids cells store energy for long-term use?\nOptions:\n A. meat\nB. fat\nC. nuts\nD. treasure","completion":"fat\nExplanation: Lipids Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are united by a common feature. Lipids are hydrophobic (\u201cwaterfearing\u201d), or insoluble in water, because they are nonpolar molecules. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of lipids called fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 2.17). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry because of their water-repelling nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of the plasma membrane. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids."}

{"prompt":"Question: Chemical reactions follow which laws?\nOptions:\n A. Physics Analysis\nB. thermodynamics\nC. Chemical kinetics\nD. Archie's law","completion":"thermodynamics\nExplanation: Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states the energy available after a chemical reaction is always less than that at the beginning of a reaction. This is also commonly referred to as entropy. Entropy can be described as the degree of disorder in a system . That is, as energy is transferred from one form to another, some of the energy is lost as heat, and the amount of available energy decreases. As the energy decreases, the disorder in the system increases, and, by definition, the entropy increases. Ice melting provides an example in which entropy increases. Entropy essentially is a measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction."}

{"prompt":"Question: Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded by this?\nOptions:\n A. cartilage\nB. epithelial tissue\nC. connective tissue\nD. soft tissue","completion":"connective tissue\nExplanation: develops from myoblasts derived from the mesoderm. Myocytes and their numbers remain relatively constant throughout life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded by connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the membranes. The striation is due to the regular alternation of the contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with the structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a result of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber. Cardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also appear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a single centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own intrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell junctions called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached cells form long, branching cardiac muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium allowing the cells to synchronize their actions. The cardiac muscle pumps blood through the body and is under involuntary control. The attachment junctions hold adjacent cells together across the dynamic pressures changes of the cardiac cycle. Smooth muscle tissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs. It forms the contractile component of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the airways and arteries. Each cell is spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18)."}
{"prompt":"Question: Fungus-like protist saprobes play what role in a food chain and are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes?\nOptions:\n A. aphids\nB. Soil\nC. decomposers\nD. fluxes","completion":"decomposers\nExplanation: Agents of Decomposition The fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes. For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. Saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain.

{"prompt":"Question: Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of what?\nOptions:\n A. molecular oxygen\nB. molecular carbon\nC. molecular nitrogen\nD. atomic oxygen","completion":"molecular oxygen\nExplanation: Visit this site (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/fermentation2) to see anaerobic cellular respiration in action. Other fermentation methods occur in bacteria. Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like Clostridia bacteria, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them upon exposure. It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. The various methods of fermentation are used by different organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+ for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these pathways, that step would not occur, and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose."}

{"prompt":"Question: What regulates the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to cdks?\nOptions:\n A. cyclins\nB. kinases\nC. subclades\nD. hormones","completion":"cyclins\nExplanation: Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To be fully active, the Cdk\/cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in specific locations. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate other proteins. Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase. (Figure 10.12). The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however, the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk\/cyclin complexes form. The different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints."}

{"prompt":"Question: Melting points are temperatures that are high enough to separate liquids from which substances?\nOptions:\n A. solids\nB. gases\nC. seeds\nD. oils","completion":"solids\nExplanation: The melting point of a substance is the temperature that separates a solid and a liquid. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature that separates a liquid and a gas. What accounts for this variability? Why do some substances become liquids at very low temperatures, while others require very high temperatures before they become liquids? It all depends on the strength of the intermolecular interactions between the particles of substances. (Although ionic compounds are not composed of discrete molecules, we will still use the term intermolecular to include interactions between the ions in such compounds. ) Substances that experience strong intermolecular interactions require higher temperatures to become liquids and, finally, gases.

{"prompt":"Question: Arguably the most important ingredient in saliva for digestion is a type of what, which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates?\nOptions:\n A. enzyme\nB. amino\nC. genes\nD. fatty","completion":"enzyme\nExplanation: Saliva Saliva is essentially (95.5 percent) water. The remaining 4.5 percent is a complex mixture of ions, glycoproteins, enzymes, growth factors, and waste products. Perhaps the most important ingredient in salvia from the perspective of digestion is the enzyme salivary amylase, which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates. Food does not spend enough time in the mouth to allow all the carbohydrates to break down, but salivary amylase continues acting until it is inactivated by stomach acids. Bicarbonate and phosphate ions function as chemical buffers, maintaining saliva at a pH between 6.35 and 6.85. Salivary mucus helps lubricate food, facilitating movement in the mouth, bolus formation, and swallowing. Saliva contains immunoglobulin A, which prevents microbes from penetrating the epithelium, and lysozyme, which makes saliva antimicrobial. Saliva also contains epidermal growth factor, which might have given rise to the adage \u201ca mother\u2019s kiss can heal a wound. \u201d Each of the major salivary glands secretes a unique formulation of saliva according to its cellular makeup. For example, the parotid glands secrete a watery solution that contains salivary amylase. The submandibular glands have cells similar to those of the parotid glands, as well as mucus-secreting cells. Therefore, saliva secreted by the submandibular glands also contains amylase but in a liquid thickened with mucus. The sublingual glands contain mostly mucous cells, and they secrete the thickest saliva with the least amount of salivary amylase."}

This end is called hydrophobic (\"water hating\"). The nonpolar tails are on the inside of the membrane. The polar heads are on the outside of the membrane. These differences in polarity allow some molecules to pass through the membrane while keeping others out. You can see how this works in the video at the URL below."}
{"prompt":"Question: The earth\u2019s biomes are categorized into two major groups named what?\nOptions:\n A. icelandic and aquatic\nB. aquatic and galactic\nC. terrestrial and aquatic\nD. terrestrial and galactic","completion":"terrestrial and aquatic\nExplanation: 44.3 | Terrestrial Biomes By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes \u2022 Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes The Earth\u2019s biomes are categorized into two major groups: terrestrial and aquatic. Terrestrial biomes are based on land, while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes. The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. Comparing the annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes. Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome and the vegetation type in the biome. The distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar climates (Figure 44.12)."}

{"prompt":"Question: The primary hormones derived from lipids are what?\nOptions:\n A. amino acids\nB. steroids\nC. melatonins\nD. antibiotics","completion":"steroids\nExplanation: Steroid Hormones The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens\u2014which are produced by the gonads (testes and ovaries)\u2014are steroid hormones. The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism. Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic). Because blood is water-based, lipidderived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein. This more complex structure extends the half-life of steroid hormones much longer than that of hormones derived from amino acids. A hormone\u2019s half-life is the time required for half the concentration of the hormone to be degraded. For example, the lipid-derived hormone cortisol has a half-life of approximately 60 to 90 minutes. In contrast, the amino acid\u2013derived hormone epinephrine has a half-life of approximately one minute."}

{"prompt":"Question: An allele is an alternative form of what structure?\nOptions:\n A. amino acid\nB. enzyme\nC. protein\nD. gene","completion":"gene\nExplanation: You have learned that an allele is an alternative form of a gene. Most, if not all genes have alternative forms causing the resulting protein to function slightly differently. But are there alleles that cause proteins to function dramatically differently or not function at all? A mutation is a change in the DNA or RNA sequence, and many mutations result in new alleles. Some mutations have no effect on the protein, whereas others are either beneficial or harmful. In fact, evolution could not take place without the genetic variation that results from beneficial mutations. In humans, harmful mutations can result in genetic diseases. There are also chromosomal mutations, large changes with dramatic effects. See Mutations are changes in genetic information at http:\/\/www. dnaftb. org\/27\/animation. html for a description of the early work on mutations."}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the smallest contractile portion of a muscle?\nOptions:\n A. filaments\nB. cell\nC. sarcomere\nD. capillary","completion":"sarcomere\nExplanation: 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation A sarcomere is the smallest contractile portion of a muscle. Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin filaments. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin; thin filaments are composed of the protein actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins. Muscle contraction is described by the sliding filament model of contraction. ACh is the neurotransmitter that binds at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger depolarization, and an action potential travels along the sarcolemma to trigger calcium release from SR. The actin sites are exposed after Ca++ enters the sarcoplasm from its SR storage to activate the troponin-tropomyosin complex so that the tropomyosin shifts away from the sites. The cross-bridging of myposin heads docking into actin-binding sites is followed by the \u201cpower stroke\u201d\u2014the sliding of the thin filaments by thick filaments. The power strokes are powered by ATP. Ultimately, the sarcomeres, myofibrils, and muscle fibers shorten to produce movement."}

It contains several structures, including ribosomes, a cytoskeleton, and genetic material. Ribosomes are sites where proteins are made. The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape. The genetic material is usually a single loop of DNA. There may also be small, circular pieces of DNA, called plasmids . (see Figure below ). The cytoplasm may contain microcompartments as well. These are tiny structures enclosed by proteins. They contain enzymes and are involved in metabolic processes."}
{"prompt":"Question: What do we call zeros that appear after nonzero digits?\nOptions:\n A. right-end zeros\nB. left-end zeros\nC. significant digits\nD. placeholders","completion":"right-end zeros\nExplanation: 4. Zeros that appear after all nonzero digits are called right-end zeros. Right-end zeros in a number that lacks a decimal point are not significant. A. 140 has two significant figures."}
{"prompt":"Question: A hair grows out of a follicle and passes through what before extending above the skin surface?\nOptions:\n A. dermis\nB. epidermis\nC. callus\nD. cartilage","completion":"epidermis\nExplanation: Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface."}
{"prompt":"Question: Many organisms look very similar to other organisms because they may be from the same what?\nOptions:\n A. species\nB. nutrients\nC. area\nD. parasites","completion":"species"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area?\nOptions:\n A. energy\nB. pressure\nC. gravity\nD. resistance","completion":"pressure\nExplanation: Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random. As a result, they are always bumping into each other and other things. This is modeled in the Figure below . The force of the particles against things they bump into creates pressure. Pressure is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area. How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving. The more gas particles there are and the faster they are moving, the greater the pressure they create.

{"prompt":"Question: Which organ of the body do large tapeworms attack or block?\nOptions:\n A. liver\nB. intestines\nC. heart\nD. kidneys","completion":"intestines"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell?\nOptions:\n A. cell wall\nB. cell barrier\nC. cell shield\nD. cell root","completion":"cell wall\nExplanation: A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. In fact, two other classes of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectic polysaccharides, can comprise 30% of the dry mass of the cell wall. The cell wall provides structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell."}
