Although it doesn't look like anything special, I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to crack this, with no luck. Most likely, due to the late hour, I am missing something very trivial here.\n\nProve that for any integer $n$, the number $11^{n+1}+12^{2n-1}$ is divisible by $133$.\n\nI have tried multiplying through by $12$ and rearranging, but like I said with meager results. I arrived at $11^{n+2}+12^{2n+1}$ which satisfies the induction hypothesis for LHS, but for the RHS I got stuck at $12 \\times 133m-11^{n+1}-11^{n+3}$ or $12^2 \\times 133m-12 \\times11^{n+1}-11^{n+3}$ and several other combinations none of which would let me factor out $133$.\n\n-\nAnswers below are great, but isn't this proof formulated incorrectly? This is only true for the natural numbers, not integers, since $11 + 12^{-1} < 133$ \u2013\u00a0 Dancrumb May 29 '12 at 13:22\n@Dancrumb I've copi\"\n\nDo not just list concepts, but develop each one in detail before moving to the next, as we prioritize depth of understanding and comprehensive exploration of the subject matter over breadth.

Since both the exponent in the numerator and denominator are powers of 2, we can simplify the expression by subtracting the exponents. This gives us \\(2^{(x+y)^2-(x-y)^2}\\). At this point, it would be beneficial to expand both squares, which results in \\(2^{x^2+2xy+y^2-x^2+2xy-y^2} = 2^{4xy}\\) since many terms cancel out.\n\nSince xy equals 1 according to the problem statement, then \\(2^{4*1}=2^4=16\\), so the final answer is 16."}
